    <big><b>Facts</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Orthopedic emergency: potential limb threatening injury due to popliteal artery thrombosis/disruption</li>

    <li>Vascular disruption is reported in 10-65% of cases</li>

    <li>Obese patients with low-energy dislocations are at highest risk for vascular injury</li>

    <li>Hyperextension injuries typically result in anterior dislocation</li>

    <li>Dashboard injuries with the knee in flexion typically result in posterior dislocation<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Normal ROM: 10&deg; of extension to 140&deg; of flexion</li>

    <li>Knee has three compartments: patellofemoral, medial tibiofemoral and lateral tibiofemoral</li>

    <li>Menisci in both tibiofemoral compartments decrease stress by increasing conformity</li>

    <li>Femoral condyles articulate with the tibia

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>The medial condyle extends further distally than the lateral, contributing to the physiologic 6&deg; of valgus at the
        knee</li>

        <li>The medial tibial plateau is flat and larger than the lateral plateau which is concave</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>The proximal tibial has 7&deg;-10&deg; of posterior slope</li>

    <li>Gerdy's tubercle (lateral) is the insertion of the iliotibial (IT) band</li>

    <li>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) arises from the posterolateral femoral notch and inserts anterior to the tibial
    eminences

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Resists anterior translation of the tibia</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) arises from the anteromedial femoral notch and inserts on the posterior tibia

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Resists posterior translation of the tibia</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Knee has three layers:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Layer I: fascial layer that includes the sartorious fascia (medial), the IT band and biceps femoris fascia
        (lateral)</li>

        <li>Layer II: patellar tendon, superficial MCL and LCL</li>

        <li>Layer III: deep MCL, fabellofibular and arcuate ligaments (lateral)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Baker's cyst: posterior synovial connection to a popliteal bursa between the semimembranosus and medial
    gastrocnemius</li>

    <li>Dislocations typically result from disruption of at least one cruciate ligament and variable disruption of collateral
    ligaments, capsule and menisci</li>

    <li>Popliteal vessels emerge from adductor hiatus to enter the popliteal fossa

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Five geniculate branches supply the knee</li>

        <li>Proceeds under soleus through a fibrous tunnel</li>

        <li>Results in tethering proximally and distally that puts popliteal vessels at risk</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Anterior and posterior dislocations occur equally, each accounting for 30-40%<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Patients with knee dislocations present with deformity, severe pain and inability to ambulate

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Spontaneous reduction can occur, resulting in more subtle signs of injury at presentation (e.g. effusion, laxity,
        etc.)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Immediate knee reduction should be performed</li>

    <li>Assess NV status and identify associated injuries

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Most common finding in patients with vascular injury is diminished or absent pulses

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Additional findings include active hemorrhage, expanding hematoma (popliteal fossa), distal ischemia, bruit</li>

            <li>Consider noninvasive Doppler studies for any equivocal findings</li>

            <li>Angiography should be performed in patients with abnormal vascular examination</li>

            <li>Gross vascular disruption should proceed directly to the operating room</li>

            <li>Flow must be reestablished within 6-8 hours</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Evaluate knee for open wounds</li>

        <li>Peroneal nerve injury (10-40%) associated with posterolateral dislocations</li>

        <li>Note other fractures about the knee including tibial eminence, tibial tubercle and proximal fibula</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>A patient presenting with a knee reduced in the field and history of acute dislocation remains at risk for vascular
    injury and should be evaluated equally urgently</li>

    <li>Patient should be monitored closely for 1 week for delayed presentation of vascular injury (e.g. intimal tears, late
    thrombosis)</li>

    <li>Compartment syndrome: sustained increase in compartment pressure due to inflammation and edema in one or more of the leg
    compartments leading to vascular compromise and muscle death

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Muscle death occurs 6-8 hours after the onset of compartment syndrome</li>

        <li>Severe pain with passive motion of the toes/foot is often first sign</li>

        <li>Other signs include tense swelling of the calf, diminished pulses, pain out of proportion to injury and paresthesias

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Serial neurovascular exams are required as compartment syndrome can develop more than 24 hours after injury</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Compartment pressures should be measured in patients with clincal signs of compartment syndrome

          <ul class="second-level">
            <li>Compartment pressure &gt; 30 mmHg or within 30 mmHg of the diastolic blood pressure warrant urgent fasciotomies
            of the leg compartments</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Deep posterior compartment pressure may be elevated in the presence of a soft superficial compartment

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Missed posterior compartment syndrome can result in claw toe deformity</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
