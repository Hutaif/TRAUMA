    <big><b>Treatment</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>
      <b>Nonoperative</b>: indicated for minimally displaced fractures (&lt; 1 cm of translation and 45&deg; of angulation), valgus
      impacted two-part surgical neck fractures or fracture-dislocations of the greater tuberosity that reduce following
      concentric reduction of the shoulder joint (most GT fractures reduce with closed reduction of the joint)

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Sling immobilization followed by early ROM at 2 weeks</li>

        <li>Elbow and hand mobilization should begin immediately</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Operative</b>: indications include angulation &gt; 45&deg;, displacement &gt; 1 cm (5 mm for greater tuberosity) or
      fracture-dislocations

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Objective is to restore articular and tuberosity anatomy while minimizing vascular supply to the humeral head</li>

        <li>Fixation options include closed reduction/percutaneous pinning (CRPP) or ORIF with transosseous sutures, conventional
        plate fixation or locked plate fixation</li>

        <li>CRPP is most appropriate for two-part surgical neck fractures in non-osteoporotic patients</li>

        <li>Locked plates with fixed angle screws are preferred for osteoporotic bone and metaphyseal comminution</li>

        <li>Most fractures can be fixed via a deltapectoral or deltoid splitting (for GT fracture) approach</li>

        <li>Minimize soft tissue dissection along medial metaphysis to reduce vascular disruption to the humeral head</li>

        <li>Hemiarthroplasty is appropriate for marked articular comminution</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Two-part</u>:
    </li>

    <li>Anatomic neck: high rate of osteonecrosis

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>ORIF or hemiarthroplasty in older patients</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Surgical neck: valgus impacted patterns do well nonoperatively

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Closed reduction should be attempted followed by stabilization by percutaneous pinning if acceptable alignment is
        achieved</li>

        <li>Irreducible or complex/comminuted fractures can be fixed with proximal humeral plates</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Greater tuberosity fracture: screw or suture fixation &plusmn; cuff repair

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Can be accessed via a superior deltoid splitting approach</li>

        <li>Arthroscopic fixation can allows evaluation of the labrum and cartilage while avoiding deltoid dissection</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Lesser tuberosity fracture: isolated displaced fractures are rare

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Can be treated with excision and subscapularis advancement or screw fixation</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Three-part</u>: generally ORIF is preferred with suture fixation of tuberosity fragments and locking plate fixation of
      the metaphysis
    </li>

    <li>Bone grafting may be required to buttress impacted segments</li>

    <li>Hemiarthroplasty should be considered for elderly patients with poor bone quality<br />
    <br />
    <u>Four-part</u>: high incidence of osteonecrosis</li>

    <li>CRPP or ORIF can be considered in valgus impacted fractures</li>

    <li>When valgus impaction is not present ORIF can be considered for high-demand patients or patients &lt; 40 years</li>

    <li>Otherwise hemiarthroplasty is the preferred treatment<br />
    <br />
    <u>Impression</u>: treated like reverse Hill-Sachs lesion</li>

    <li>Defect &lt; 20% of articular surface: transfer of the lesser tuberosity and subscapularis into defect</li>

    <li>Defect &lt; 40%: osteochondral allograft or bone grafting</li>

    <li>Defect &gt; 40%: hemiarthroplasty<br />
    <br />
    <u>Fracture-dislocation</u>:</li>

    <li>Two part fracture-dislocations of the greater or lesser tuberosities may reduce after closed shoulder reduction and can
    be treated nonoperatively (see above)</li>

    <li>For fractures involving the anatomic or surgical neck:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>ORIF can be considered for younger patients</li>

        <li>Hemiarthroplasty is generally recommended for advanced age, poor bone stock or severe comminution</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul><br />

  <div class="page-title">
    <big><b>Complications</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Malunion: often due to failed ORIF or nonanatomic reduction

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Varus deformity (collapse) usually the result of medial metaphyseal comminution</li>

        <li>Associated with poor functional outcomes</li>

        <li>Corrective osteotomy can be considered</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Nerve injuries: brachial plexus and axillary nerve injuries</li>

    <li>Nonunion: seen with two part surgical neck fractures due to soft tissue interposition</li>

    <li>Osteonecrosis: 3-14% of three-part and 13-34% of four-part fractures

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Risk increases with displacement</li>

        <li>Leads to posttraumatic arthritis</li>

        <li>Anatomic reconstruction may allow sufficient perfusion by posteromedial vessels</li>

        <li>Symptomatic cases can be treated with hemiarthroplasty</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Shoulder stiffness: increased risk with arthroplasty to treat fracture-dislocation

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Associated with residual greater tuberosity displacement (subacromial impingement)</li>

        <li>Can be a result of capsular contracture</li>

        <li>Avoid by initiating early passive shoulder motion</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Posttraumatic arthritis: a consequence of any articular injury, can be theoretically minimized with anatomic
    reduction</li>

    <li>Vascular injuries: axillary artery is at risk, requires vascular surgery consultation</li>
  </ul>
