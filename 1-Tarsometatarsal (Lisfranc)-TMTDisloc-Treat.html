  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Generally require operative treatment to achieve anatomic alignment and stable fixation<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>
      <b>Nonoperative</b>: indicated for minimally displaced (&lt; 2 mm), without fracture and stable to radiographic stress

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>NWB SLC for 6 weeks</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Operative</b>: generally preferred for any medically stable patient with instability (&gt; 2 mm of displacement)

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Massive swelling should be treated initially with provisional closed reduction to protect the soft tissue from
        further damage

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Reduction can be achieved with manual manipulation to reverse deformity under sufficient anesthesia</li>

            <li>Occasionally reduction can be prevented by interposition of soft tissue</li>

            <li>Reduction is followed by splinting and elevation with monitoring for compartment syndrome</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>ORIF beginning medially, focused on reducing the 2nd MT base

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Two longitudinal incisions: one over 1st intermetatarsal space and the other base of the 4th MT</li>

            <li>Fixation achieved with K-wires or screws</li>

            <li>Bone grafting can be used for impaction fractures</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Stiffness is tolerated given limited physiologic motion</li>

        <li>SLC NWB for 6-8 weeks followed by a walking cast for 4-6 weeks</li>
      </ul>

    <big><b>Complications</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Compartment syndrome: requires urgent fasciotomies to release pressure and avoid muscle death</li>

    <li>Posttraumatic arthritis: a consequence of any articular injury, can be theoretically minimized with anatomic reduction

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Can be amenable to arch supports but may require arthrodesis</li>
      </ul>
