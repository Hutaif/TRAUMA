    <big><b>Treatment</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Cleanse and dress open wounds acutely</li>

    <li>Apply long leg posterior splint in anticipation of definitive care<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>
      <b>Nonoperative</b>: indicated for minimally displaced (&lt; 2 mm), stable fractures, particularly in elderly patients or
      those with significant comorbid medical conditions that preclude operative treatment

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Minimally displaced fractures can be treated with a NWB LLC with the knee flexed to 20&deg; for 4-8 weeks</li>

        <li>Early mobilization can be achieved with hinged knee brace</li>

        <li>Higher energy fractures can be treated in skeletal traction with ROM exercises, followed by cast immobilization</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Operative</b>: indications include displaced (&gt; 2 mm), unstable or open fractures, compartment syndrome and vascular
      injuries

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Objective is to reconstruct the articular surface, recreate normal tibial alignment and provide soft tissue coverage
        over the fracture</li>

        <li>Arthroscopy can be used to evaluate the articular surface and assist in fracture reduction</li>

        <li>External fixation can be used if the patient is unfit for surgery or has compromised soft tissues</li>

        <li>Consider delaying surgery until swelling has subsided and local skin conditions have improved</li>

        <li>Fracture can be approached through a anterolateral or posteromedial incision depending on location</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Type I-III</u>: low-energy

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Reduce joint surface under direct visualization</li>

        <li>Fill voids left by elevation of depressed articular fragments with bone graft</li>

        <li>Provisional fixation with K-wires</li>

        <li>"Rafting" 3.5 mm screws placed subchondrally provide support for articular surface</li>

        <li>Precontoured lateral plates provide buttress</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Type IV-VI</u>: high-energy

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Temporary knee-spanning external fixation allows restoration of alignment in the setting of soft tissue swelling,
        open fracture or other need to delay surgery

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Allows for ongoing wound care and faster resolution of soft tissue swelling</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Knee-sparing ring or hybrid fixator can be used as definitive fixation in the setting of severe soft tissue injury

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Condylar fractures can be stabilized by lag screws</li>

            <li>Wires capture the articular block allowing fixation to the metaphysis via the fixator</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Open reduction can be achieved via posteromedial &plusmn; anterolateral incisions</li>

        <li>Rafting screws can be placed in combination with pre-contoured buttress plates</li>

        <li>Less Invasive Stabilization System (LISS): particularly useful for metaphyseal comminution

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Acts as a laterally based internal fixator with locking fixed angle screws</li>

            <li>Preserves periosteal blood supply by not depending on bone-plate friction</li>

            <li>After articular injury is addressed, this precontoured plate is passed submuscularly over proximal tibia in
            antegrade fashion, bridging any metaphyseal comminution</li>

            <li>Utilizes indirect fracture reduction and limited surgical dissection</li>

            <li>Screws are placed percutaneously using special jigs</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>Fasciotomy:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Compartment pressure &gt; 30 mmHg or within 30 mmHg of the diastolic blood pressure warrants urgent fasciotomies of
        the leg compartments (anterior, lateral, deep/superficial posterior)</li>

        <li>Can be performed through two incisions

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Anterolateral allows release of the anterior and lateral compartments</li>

            <li>Medial incision allows release of the superficial and deep posterior compartments</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul><br />

  <div class="page-title">
    <big><b>Complications</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Compartment syndrome: rare but increased risk with higher energy closed injuries

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Urgent fasciotomy is required to release pressure and avoid muscle death</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Infection: 10% of high-energy fractures

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Can be due to ill-timed incisions through compromised skin</li>

        <li>May require delayed primary closure or flap coverage</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Knee stiffness: common and can be related to initial injury, surgical scarring or prolonged immobilization</li>

    <li>Loss of fixation: related to bone quality

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Often results in varus deformity</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Malunion/nonunion: most commonly Schatzker VI at the metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Related to comminution, unstable fixation, infection and implant failure</li>

        <li>Malunions of &gt; 10&deg; are correlated with poorer outcomes</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Peroneal nerve injury: most common with lateral injuries</li>

    <li>Popliteal artery injuries: increased risk with tibial plateau fractures associated with knee dislocation</li>

    <li>Posttraumatic arthritis: a consequence of any articular injury, can be theoretically minimized with anatomic
    reduction</li>

    <li>Thromboembolic disease: present in up to 10% of cases</li>
  </ul>
