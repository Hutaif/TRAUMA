    <big><b>Basic Principles</b></big>
  </div>

  <p><b>Fracture healing</b> can occur through either primary/direct bone healing or secondary/indirect healing:</p>

  <p><u>Primary/direct bone healing</u>: occurs under conditions of absolute stability (see below) where cortical
  contact exists across very small gaps. Blood vessels infiltrate this gap followed by mesenchymal cells that differentiate into
  osteoblasts and lay down new woven bone. Haversian remodeling then occurs in which osteoclasts in cutting cones resorb the
  necrotic fracture ends and replace the woven bone with new osteons.</p>

  <p><u>Secondary/indirect bone healing</u>: occurs under conditions of relative stability. Depends heavily on
  periosteal blood supply leading to the formation of radiographically visible callus. Occurs through 4 stages:</p>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Inflammation (at 0 weeks): characterized by fracture hematoma and generalized inflammatory response. Macrophages, mast
    cells and leukocytes infiltrate fracture and begin resorbing nectoric bone. Ingrowth of blood vessels occurs followed by
    gradual replacement of fracture hematoma with granulation tissue.</li>

    <li>Soft callus (at 3 weeks): mesenchymal cells from the periosteum differentiate into chondroblasts and fibroblasts leading
    to fibrous replacement of the hematoma and increased cellularity. New bone formation begins with chondroblasts laying down
    hyaline cartilage.</li>

    <li>Hard callus (at 12 weeks): soft callus is converted to bone by enchondral ossification (bone replacement of a cartilage
    model) and intramembranous ossification (direct bone formation from bone matrix laid by osteoblasts).</li>

    <li>Remodelling: takes places after bones have solidly united with hard callus. Original bone geometry is recreated (or
    attempted) over the course of months to years.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>Methods of immobilization</b> commonly used in skeletal trauma:</p>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li><u>Splint</u>: stabilizes and reduces fracture or joint motion without circumferential compression. Often used in the
    acute setting when swelling is present or for temporary stabilization.</li>

    <li><u>Cast</u>: reduces fracture or joint motion through circumferential compression. Generally used when fractures are
    stable, in acceptable alignment and soft tissue injury is minimal/absent. Long casts provide immobilization of adjacent
    proximal joint when appropriate. Thumb spica casts include and immobilize the thumb when needed.</li>

    <li><u>Walking boot</u>: removable boot that immobilizes the ankle and protects the ankle/foot for patients with injuries
    appropriate for weight-bearing.</li>

    <li><u>Hinged knee brace</u>: provides varus/valgus stabilization while allowing flexion and extension of the knee</li>

    <li><u>External fixation</u>: stabilization that is achieved using pins placed perpendicularly into bone percutaneously
    through the skin and linked to external bars or rings. Often used in emergency settings or when patient is otherwise not
    amenable to open fixation.</li>

    <li><u>Intramedullary nail</u>: acts as an internal splint within the medullary canal of the bone. Experiences lower bending
    moment due to intramedullary placement. Can generally allow some weight-bearing and early mobilization.</li>

    <li><u>Buttress plate</u>: enhances stability and support against axial/shear deformation by applying a force 90&deg; to the
    vector of potential deformity. Most often used around the metaphysis of long bones.</li>

    <li><u>Neutralization plate</u>: redistributes load through the plate rather than through the fracture. Used to reduce the
    load experienced by lag screws.</li>

    <li><u>Compression plate</u>: eccentrically tapered holes allow compression across a fracture upon application of screws.
    Low-contact dynamic compression plates (LC-DCPs) minimize periosteal vascular disruption by decreasing the bone-plate contact
    area while allowing compression through the fracture.</li>

    <li><u>Lag screw</u>: a screw placed 90&deg; to the fracture line that engages only the distal fragment. When tightened, this
    configuration creates interfragmentary compression.</li>

    <li><u>Locking plate</u>: screws thread into both the bone and the plate, forming a rigid, fixed-angle construct that does
    not rely on bone-plate friction (like conventional plates), allowing it to function like an internal fixator. Individual
    screws cannot toggle within the plate, decreasing the likelihood of fixation failure (entire construct must fail as a unit).
    Advantageous in osteoporotic bone where conventional screw purchase of bone may be tenuous.</li>

    <li><u>Tension band</u>: an implant construct that converts a tensile (unstable) force into a compressive (stable)
    force.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>Fracture stability</b> can be grouped into relative and absolute stability:<br />
  <br />
  <u>Relative stability</u> methods allow some motion at the fracture site. These include casts, IM nails and external fixators.
  Depending on the amount of motion, this can either stimulate fracture callus (e.g. micro-motion) or inhibit bony bridging and
  union (e.g. gross motion). This concept is captured in interfragmentary strain theory. Strain is deformation due to an
  application of a force. The amount of strain that will be tolerated by a healing fracture is dependent on the characteristics
  of the fracture. For example, a comminuted fracture will tolerate relatively more deformation than a simple fracture because
  the motion is spread over more fragments such that each individual bone interface experiences only a fraction of this motion. A
  simple fracture has just one bone interface that must absorb all of this deformation. Above a certain threshold, the applied
  strain will preclude fracture healing and lead to nonunion. This concept governs which methods of immobilization are
  suitable.</p>

  <p><u>Absolute stability</u> refers to fixation in which motion (strain) is reduced nearly completely such that
  direct bone healing can occur. This can be achieved with interfragmentary compression with lag screws or compression
  plates.</p>

  <p><b>Immobilization of joints</b>: an intrinsic trade-off exists between immobilization and motion. Striking the
  right balance is part of the art of orthopedics. Immobilization is necessary to allow sufficient time for bones and ligaments
  to heal after injury. However, without the usual motion experienced by joints, stiffness can develop due to contracture and
  scarring, limiting range of motion. Furthermore, fracture healing can be facilitated by a limited amount of (micro)motion. This
  phenomenon is reflected in the formation of radiographically visible fracture callus. Once joint motion is lost, it is often
  very difficult to regain even with the most rigorous of physical therapy regimens. Therefore, interval radiographic follow-up
  and early range of motion when appropriate are generally good practices.</p>

  <p><b>Orthopedic examination</b>: many orthopedic trauma patients experience high-energy mechanisms. Life
  threatening injuries should always be addressed first, following standard Acute Trauma Life Support procedures and protocols. A
  complete history and physical examination including thorough neurovascular evaluation are always required. Injury mechanisms
  confer information about injury patterns and energy that are useful in consideration of treatment options. Comorbidities may
  increase suspicion for particular injuries (e.g. metastatic cancer) or impact care decisions (e.g. uncontrolled diabetes). The
  social history can contain information such as tobacco use that may influence treatment. The obvious deformity in one extremity
  should never preclude consideration of other injuries that may be less obvious.</p>

  <p><b>Injury mechanism</b>: higher energy mechanisms typically result in more complex fracture patterns (where some
  of the energy is dissipated) and soft tissue injury (where the remainder of the energy is dissipated). Understanding the injury
  mechanism allows inferences to be drawn regarding the extent of soft tissue injury given a bony injury. For example, a simple
  fracture pattern in the setting of very high-energy trauma should raise suspicion for severe soft tissue injury and concern for
  compartment syndrome.</p>

  <p><b>Damage control orthopedics</b> is a concept that promotes delaying definitive orthopedic treatment in a
  poly-traumatized patient until his/her general condition has stabilized. Expedient stabilization (e.g. external fixation) of
  long bone and pelvic fractures can be achieved in the acute setting allowing the treatment team to focus on life threatening
  injuries and resuscitation. The flexibility of properly applied external fixation to serve as definitive fixation is useful in
  cases of severely ill patients. Temporizing orthopedic treatment in this manner provides fracture stability while minimizing
  the "second hit" associated with the physiological burden of surgery in patients at risk for multi-organ failure and acute
  respiratory distress. Patients at risk typically demonstrate hemodynamic instability, difficult resuscitation, polytrauma,
  coagulopathy and hypothermia. Immunological markers such as IL-6 or lactate can be used to monitor inflammatory response and
  resuscitation of at-risk patients.</p>

  <p><b>Post-reduction radiographs</b> should be obtained in every instance of fracture or joint manipulation to
  confirm reduction.</p>

  <p><b>Open fractures</b>, in general, require urgent irrigation and debridement in the operating room to decrease
  the risk of local infection and sepsis. Provisional irrigation and cleansing should be performed upon initial presentation,
  followed by application of an iodine (bacteriocidal) dressing and temporary stabilization (e.g. splint). Expedient formal
  irrigation and debridement should be performed with urgency based on the degree of contamination. Negative pressure wound
  therapy has also been shown to decrease infection rates and improve outcomes when used as initial treatment of open fractures.
  Systemic antimicrobial treatment should be considered based on intraoperative findings, plan for fixation and other associated
  injuries.</p>

  <p><b>Compartment syndrome</b> refers to the compression of nerves, vessels and muscle within a closed space. This
  can occur in any fascial compartment in which a sustained increase in pressure is present. This is most commonly due to
  inflammation, swelling and/or hematoma associated with trauma. Viability of the compartment contents is threatened when the
  pressure within the compartment precludes blood flow into the compartment. This is generally believed to occur when the
  pressure within the compartment is &gt; 30 mmHg or when it is within 30 mmHg of the diastolic blood pressure. Clinical signs
  include pain with passive stretch of the involved muscles, tense swelling of the compartment, diminished distal pulses, pain
  out of proportion to injury and paresthesias. Compartment syndrome must always be considered and compartment pressures measured
  when clinical signs are present. High-risk patients must be closely monitored because compartment syndrome can develop more
  than 24 hours after injury. A diagnosis of compartment syndrome warrants urgent decompression of the compartment by
  fasciotomy.</p>

  <p><b>Pregnant trauma patients</b> require additional attention. Differences in maternal physiology include increased
  blood volume, cardiac output, minute ventilation and decreased lung volume. These changes must be taken into account during
  resuscitation. An obstetrician should be consulted during the primary evaluation to assess the fetus as shock responses are
  often present in the fetus before the mother. Pregnant trauma victims beyond 20 weeks may benefit from 20&deg; of leftward logroll
  to relieve aortocaval compression during evaluation. Nonurgent/emergent injuries can often be deferred until the post-partum
  period. Radiation risk to the fetus is greatest before 15 weeks of development. After 25 weeks the CNS and organ systems are
  more radioresistant. Radiation exposure during necessary studies can be minimized with appropriate shielding. Radio-labeled and
  gadolinium contrast studies are contraindicated during pregnancy but iodinated contrast is believed to be relatively safe.
  General and regional anesthesia are low risk in pregnant patients. Midazolam should not be used for conscious sedation
  (possible teratogen). Lidocaine has been shown to be safe in pregnancy. Cephalosporins and clindamycin are considered safe
  without the need for dosing adjustments. Narcotics and acetaminophen are also considered safe during pregnancy. Aspirin is
  contraindicated. Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state therefore DVT prophylaxis is appropriate for 4 weeks or until the patient
  is mobilizing well (whichever is longer). Warfarin is believed to be a teratogen. Low molecular weight heparin is considered
  safe.</p>
