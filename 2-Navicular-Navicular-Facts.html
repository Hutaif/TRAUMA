    <big><b>Facts</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Isolated injuries are rare</li>

    <li>Usually the result of a direct blow or loading along the axis of the foot<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Articulates with the three cuneiforms distally, the cuboid laterally and the talus proximally

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Strong ligaments anchor the navicular to the cuneiforms</li>

        <li>Also serves as the insertion of the calcaneonavicular (spring), tibionavicular portion of the superficial deltoid and
        talonavicular ligaments</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Two column concept: structural description of the foot

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Medial: 1st, 2nd and 3rd MTs, the 3 cuneiforms, navicular and talus</li>

        <li>Lateral: 4th and 5th MTs, cuboid and calcaneus</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Accessory navicular (os tibiale externum) is present in 25% and bilateral in 64% of cases

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Located within the posterior tibial tendon which attaches medially</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Blood supply from the posterior tibial (medial), medial plantar artery (plantar) and dorsalis pedis (dorsal) arteries

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Medial and lateral areas are well vascularized compared to central portion where stress fractures often occur
        (watershed area)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Stress fractures: commonly associated with running activities

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Fracture line usually sagittally oriented</li>

        <li>Usually nondisplaced</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>Patients present with pain along the dorsomedial arch and variable amounts of swelling and ecchymosis</li>

    <li>Tenderness to palpation can usually be elicited over the navicular</li>

    <li>Assess NV status and identify associated injuries</li>

    <li>Navicular fractures are often associated with injuries to adjacent structures (e.g. cuboid)</li>
