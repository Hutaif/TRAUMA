  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Fractures of the neck are most common (&gt; 50%)

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Typically result from hyperdorsiflexion injuries where talar neck impacts on distal anterior tibia (e.g. MVCs and
        falls from height)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Body fractures occur with axial loading between the tibia and calcaneus<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Approximately 60% of the talus is covered in cartilage</li>

    <li>Talus has 5 anatomic regions:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Body: articulates superiorly with the tibial plafond, medially and laterally with the malleoli, inferiorly with the
        posterior facet of the calcaneus

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Anterior aspect of the dome is wider than posterior</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Head: articulates anteriorly with the navicular and inferiorly with the sustentaculum tali of the calcaneus</li>

        <li>Neck: region between the body and head</li>

        <li>Lateral process: articulates with the posterior facet of the calcaneus and lateral malleolus</li>

        <li>Posterior process: between medial and lateral tubercles of this process is a groove for the flexor hallucis longus
        (FHL)

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Os trigonum is present in 50%: represents a separate ossification center posterior to the posterior process and
            can be confused for a fracture</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>No muscles originate or insert on the talus</li>

    <li>Tarsal canal: tunnel created by the coaptation of the talar sulcus and the interosseous sulcus of the calcaneus (between
    the middle and posterior facets)

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Creates a tunnel that runs transversely between the talus and calcaneus</li>

        <li>Opens up into the tarsal sinus laterally</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Vascular supply: predisposed to osteonecrosis due to limited vascular perforation

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Blood supply to body enters at the neck and proceeds posteriorly

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Anastomotic sling along inferior neck formed by artery of the sinus tarsi and the artery of the tarsal canal</li>

            <li>Fractures of the neck disrupt this vascular sling</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Artery of the sinus tarsi: derived from branches of the peroneal and dorsalis pedis</li>

        <li>Artery of the tarsal canal (posterior tibial): primary blood supply to body</li>

        <li>Deltoid artery (posterior tibial): supplies medial third of the body

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>May be only remaining supply in displaced fractures of the neck or body</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Dorsal neck branches (dorsalis pedis): supplies a portion of the head</li>

        <li>Posterior process vessels (peroneal): make minor contributions to the posterior process</li>

        <li>Most of the blood supply to the head and neck are from the dorsalis pedis</li>

        <li>Displaced fractures of the talar neck disrupt the dorsal neck branches, the artery to the sinus tarsi and the artery
        to the tarsal canal</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Spring (calcaneonavicular) ligament: inferior to talar head and acts like a sling to suspend</li>

    <li>Deltoid ligament (tibiotalar portion) attaches at the medial talar body</li>

    <li>Foot compartments:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Medial: abductor hallucis, flexor hallucis brevis</li>

        <li>Interosseous: 7 interossei muscles</li>

        <li>Central superficial: flexor digitorum brevis, adductor hallucis, lumbricals</li>

        <li>Central deep (calcaneal): quadratus plantae</li>

        <li>Lateral: flexor digiti minimi brevis, abductor digiti minimi, opponens digiti minimi</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>Patients present with pain with weight-bearing and ROM and demonstrate variable swelling and ecchymosis</li>

    <li>High-energy injuries require a full trauma evaluation and resuscitation</li>

    <li>Assess NV status and identify associated injuries

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>High-energy injuries are often associated with injury to the soft tissue envelope

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Up to 20% of talar fractures are open</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Concomitant malleolar fractures are common with talar body fractures</li>

        <li>Calcaneal fractures are assocatied with talar neck fractures</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Lateral process fractures have tenderness 1 cm inferior to the tip of the lateral malleolus

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Due to inversion (avulsion) or inversion (impaction)</li>

        <li>Classically associated with snowboarding</li>

        <li>Often mistaken for ankle sprain</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Posterior process fractures (Shepard's fractures) may be demonstrate FHL irritation</li>

    <li>Tenderness near the talonavicular joint medially may be elicited in talar head fractures</li>

    <li>Compartment syndrome: sustained increase in compartment pressure due to inflammation and edema in one or more of the foot
    compartments leading to vascular compromise and muscle death

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Crush injuries are particularly susceptible</li>

        <li>Signs include diminished pulses, severe swelling and pain out of proportion to injury, particularly with passive
        extension of the digits</li>

        <li>Compartment pressures should be measured when signs of compartment syndrome are present</li>

        <li>Urgent fasciotomy of the compartments is warranted for pressures within 30 mmHg of the diastolic blood pressure</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
