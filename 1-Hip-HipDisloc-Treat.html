  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Urgent concentric reduction is required to reduce risk of osteonecrosis of the femoral head and compression of the
    sciatic nerve

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Risk of osteonecrosis increases in hips unreduced for &gt; 6 hours</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Delay &gt; 12 hours worsens long-term prognosis significantly</li>

    <li>Associated femoral head and acetabular fractures can be treated subacutely</li>

    <li>Do not attempt closed reduction in the presence of ipsilateral femoral neck fractures

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Achieve provisional fixation first in the operating room then gentle reduction followed by definitive fixation of the
        femoral neck</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Closed reduction</b>:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Performed with patient under either general anesthesia or conscious sedation

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Sedation must achieve adequate muscle relaxation and pain control to minimize risk of further injury by the
            reduction maneuver</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Gentle manipulation and continuous distraction rather than bursts of traction minimize risk of iatrogenic injury
        (fracture)</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Anterior dislocation</u>

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Allis technique (superior): patient supine

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Distal traction to bring head to the level of the acetabulum</li>

            <li>IR and extension of the hip to reduce femoral head</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Allis technique (inferior): patient supine

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Distal traction with gentle hip flexion</li>

            <li>IR and adduction are combined with lateral force applied to inner thigh</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Posterior dislocation</u>

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Allis technique: patient supine

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Assistant stabilizes pelvis with downward force on the anterior superior iliac spine bilaterally</li>

            <li>Hip and knee flexion relaxes the hamstrings</li>

            <li>Continuous longitudinal traction is applied</li>

            <li>Increase traction force while increasing flexion to 70&deg; and applying gentle internal and external rotations to
            lower extremity</li>

            <li>Lateral force applied to the thigh by the assistant can be helpful</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Stimson gravity technique: patient is prone with affected extremity hanging off the end of the stretcher

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Pelvis is stabilized on the table by an assistant</li>

            <li>Knee is flexed to 90&deg;</li>

            <li>Downward-directed force is applied to the posterior calf</li>

            <li>Gentle rotation may assist reduction</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Bigelow maneuver: with patient is supine

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Assistant stabilizes pelvis with downward force on the anterior superior iliac spine bilaterally</li>

            <li>Continuous longitudinal traction is applied</li>

            <li>Hip is flexed to 90&deg; with IR and adduction to clear the acetabulum</li>

            <li>ER and abduction completes reduction</li>

            <li>High risk for iatrogenic femoral head fractures</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    <br /></li>

    <li>Post-reduction: radiographs and CT should be obtained to confirm concentric reduction and absence of incarcerated bone
    fragments

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Stability of reduction should be tested by flexing hip to 90&deg; in neutral rotation</li>

        <li>WBAT with appropriate hip precautions based on direction of dislocation if stable without fractures</li>

        <li>Consider a hip abduction brace for instability in the setting of prosthetic hip</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Open reduction</b>:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>To be performed when concentric, closed reduction cannot be achieved, concomitant fracture of the femoral head and/or
        acetabulum that requires open reduction or when there is an ipsilateral femoral neck fracture</li>

        <li>Approach depends on location of associated fracture(s):

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Posterior approach (Kocher-Langenbeck) will allow access to posterior acetabulum</li>

            <li>Anterior approach (Smith-Peterson) is often recommended for femoral head fractures

              <div type="disc">
                - Avoid removal of the capsule from the neck to prevent injury to the deep MFCA
              </div>
            </li>

            <li>Anterolateral approach (Watson-Jones) is useful for anterior dislocations and femoral head fractures</li>

            <li>Lateral approach (Hardinge) allows for anterior and posterior exposure through the same incision

              <div type="disc">
                - Avoid striping off tissue from both anterior and posterior to maintain viability
              </div>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Postoperatively patients should be placed on a short period of bed rest followed by protected weight-bearing for 4-6
        weeks following reduction</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul><br />
