  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Commonly referred to as a pilon fracture</li>

    <li>Defined as fracture involving the weight-bearing surface of the distal tibia and metaphysis</li>

    <li>Typically result from high-energy axial load &plusmn; a rotational component

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Axial loading differentiates pilon fractures from ankle (malleolar) fractures</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>Incisura fibularis: groove along the distal lateral tibia in which the fibula lies</li>

    <li>Lateral malleolus: lateral flare of the distal fibula

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Most commonly fractured</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Medial malleolus: medial flare of the distal tibia

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Inner surface divided by a groove defining an anterior (larger) and posterior colliculus</li>

        <li>Anterior colliculus is the attachment for the superficial deltoid ligament</li>

        <li>Posterior colliculus is the attachment for the deep deltoid ligament</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Posterior malleolus: posterior flare of the distal tibia

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Integrity important for posterior joint stability</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Mortise: formed by the distal tibial articular surface (plafond), medial and lateral malleoli

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Articulates with the talar dome</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Talar dome is wider anteriorly

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>In dorsiflexion, talar dome forces fibula laterally and into ER</li>

        <li>In plantarflexion, the talar dome rotates internally due to checkrein action of the deltoid ligament</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Normal ROM: dorsiflexion of 30&deg; and plantarflexion of 45&deg;

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Minimum functional ROM: -10&deg; to 20&deg;</li>

        <li>Axis of rotation is 20&deg; externally rotated compared to knee</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Leg has 4 compartments:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Anterior: tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus, peroneus tertius, anterior tibial
        vessels and deep peroneal nerve</li>

        <li>Lateral: peroneus longus, peroneus brevis and superficial peroneal nerve</li>

        <li>Deep posterior: flexor digitorum longus, flexor hallucis longus, tibialis anterior, posterior tibial vessels and the
        posterior tibial nerve</li>

        <li>Superficial posterior: gastrocnemius, plantaris and soleus</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Local structures:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Lateral:

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Peroneal tendons pass posterior to the lateral malleolus under the peroneal retinaculum</li>

            <li>Superficial to the peroneals at this level is the sural nerve and lesser saphenous vein</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Medial:

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Posterior to the medial malleolus lie the posterior tibial, flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus
            tendons, the posterior tibial vessels and tibial nerve</li>

            <li>These structures pass under the laciniate ligament (medial malleolus to calcaneus)</li>

            <li>Anterior to the medial malleolus are the saphenous vein/nerve</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Anterior:

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Under the extensor retinaculum (anteromedial tibia to anterolaterlal fibula) lie the tibialis anterior, extensor
            hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus and peroneus tertius tendons, the deep peroneal nerve and the anterior
            tibial vessels</li>

            <li>Superficial to the extensor retinaculum is the superficial peroneal nerve</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Posterior:

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Achilles and plantaris tendons</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Tibia is triangular in cross section and subcutaneous along its anteromedial border</li>

    <li>Blood supply mainly from posterior tibial artery which enters the posterolateral cortex near the soleus origin and feeds
    the endosteal vascular tree</li>

    <li>Anterior tibial artery supplies periosteal blood vessels</li>

    <li>The limited soft tissue envelope around the tibia, particularly the anteromedial surface, predisposes these factures to
    wound complications

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Highly traumatized soft tissue, even in the absence of serious wounds, are poor environments for surgical wound
        healing</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Relatively poor soft tissue vascularization around this region can complicate wound management and fracture healing

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Risk of wound complications is increased by conditions such as diabetes or peripheral vascular disease</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Gastrocnemius can be used as a muscle flap for coverage of large proximal soft tissue defects</li>

    <li>Soleus can be used for distal third defects<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Patients present nonambulatory, often with gross deformity, and variable swelling/ecchymosis</li>

    <li>Assess NV status and identify associated injuries such as such as compartment syndrome as well as vertebral compression,
    calcaneal, tibial plateau and pelvic (vertical shear) fractures

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Other injuries and fractures are present in up to 50% of cases</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Up to 20% present as open fractures

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Previously closed injuries can convert to open in the presence of displaced fractures</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Serial examinations are prudent in the setting of substantial swelling to monitor skin necrosis, fracture blisters and
    neurovascular changes

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Clear fluid-filled blisters retain epithelial cells and re-epithelialize quicker</li>

        <li>Blood filled blisters represent more significant injury and do not retain epithelial cells</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Compartment syndrome: sustained increase in compartment pressure due to inflammation and edema in one or more leg
    compartments leading to vascular compromise and muscle death

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Muscle death occurs 6-8 hours after the onset of compartment syndrome</li>

        <li>Severe pain with passive motion of the toes/foot is often first sign</li>

        <li>Other signs include tense swelling of the calf, diminished pulses, pain out of proportion to injury and paresthesias

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Serial neurovascular exams are required as compartment syndrome can develop more than 24 hours after injury</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Compartment pressures should be measured in patients with clincal signs of compartment syndrome

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Compartment pressure &gt; 30 mmHg or within 30 mmHg of the diastolic blood pressure warrant urgent fasciotomies
            of the leg compartments</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Deep posterior compartment pressure may be elevated in the presence of a soft superficial compartment

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Missed posterior compartment syndrome can result in claw toe deformity</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
