    <big><b>Facts</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>One of the most common orthopedic injuries, representing 15-20% of all fractures</li>

    <li>50% are intraarticular</li>

    <li>Bimodal distribution: young active adults (high-energy) and elderly (high-energy and insufficiency associated with
    decreased bone mineral density)<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Distal radius has three independent articular surfaces: scaphoid facet, lunate facet and sigmoid notch

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Scaphoid and lunate facets separated by an anteroposterior ridge

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Each facet articulates with its respective carpal bone</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Sigmoid notch articulates with the distal ulna

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Located just proximal to the lunate facet on the ulnar aspect of the radius</li>

            <li>Forms the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) supports the ulnar wrist

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Components: meniscal homologue, articular disk, ulnocarpal ligaments (ulnolunate and ulnotriquetral) and extensor
        carpi ulnaris sheath</li>

        <li>Articulates with the lunate and triquetrum</li>

        <li>Originates at the ulnar aspect of the radius and attaches at the base (fovea) of the ulnar styloid process</li>

        <li>Absorbs about 20% of load across wrist joint</li>

        <li>At higher risk for injury with displaced ulnar styloid fracture</li>

        <li>Radial deformity, especially shortening, can alter kinematics of the DRUJ and TFCC</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>80% of axial load is supported by the radius, 20% of axial load is supported by the ulna

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Small chances in the alignment of the distal radius can result in substantial load transfer to the ulna</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Ligamentous attachments at the distal radius often remain intact with fracture

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Facilitates reduction through ligamentotaxis</li>

        <li>Volar ligaments are stronger than dorsal ligaments</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Brachioradialis is the only muscle that inserts on the distal radius (radial styloid) and often acts as a deforming
    force</li>

    <li>Radius typically fails first volarly in tension followed by compression along the dorsal aspect and comminution depending
    on energy of trauma</li>

    <li>Radial shortening results in altered weight-bearing, ulnar impaction pain, grip weakness and loss of forearm
    rotation</li>

    <li>Increased dorsal tilt leads to abnormal wrist biomechanics, pain and degeneration at the wrist

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Can result in dorsal subluxation of the carpus and dorsal intercalated segment instability (DISI) (see
        Treatment/Complications)</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>Patients present with wrist pain, deformity and swelling</li>

    <li>Assess NV status and identify associated injuries

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Examine ipsilateral elbow and shoulder, particularly for radial head and scaphoid injuries</li>

        <li>Up to 68% of distal radius fractures are associated with soft tissue injuries such as TFCC tears (50%) or disruptions
        of the scapholunate ligament (18%)</li>

        <li>Tendon injuries can occur, classically to the extensor pollicis longus</li>

        <li>Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs in 15% due to either nerve contusion, mechanical deformation or increased pressure

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Patients typically complain of burning pain in the median distribution</li>

            <li>Urgent decompression of the carpal tunnel is warranted</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Compartment syndrome: sustained increase in compartment pressure due to inflammation and edema in forearm compartments
    leading to vascular compromise and muscle death

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Signs include pain out of proportion to injury, tense forearm compartments, pain with passive extension or flexion of
        the digits, diminished pulses</li>

        <li>Elevate arm and avoid hyperflexion of elbow</li>

        <li>Serial neurovascular checks for at risk arms</li>

        <li>Compartment pressure &gt; 30 mmHg or within 30 mmHg of the diastolic blood pressure warrants urgent fasciotomy of
        volar and dorsal compartments as well as carpal tunnel</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
