  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Most common long bone fracture</li>

    <li>Typical mechanisms include MVC (younger age groups), falls (elderly) and sport related<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Tibia is triangular in cross section and subcutaneous along its anteromedial border</li>

    <li>Blood supply mainly from posterior tibial artery which enters the posterolateral cortex near the soleus origin and feeds the endosteal
    vascular tree</li>

    <li>
      Anterior tibial artery supplies periosteal blood vessels

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Vulnerable as it passes through the interosseous membrane after branching off the popliteal artery</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      Popliteal vessels emerge from adductor hiatus to enter the popliteal fossa posteriorly

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Five geniculate branches</li>

        <li>Proceeds under soleus through a fibrous tunnel</li>

        <li>Trifurcation into posterior tibial, peroneal and anterior tibial arteries occur near this point</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      The fibula bears 15% of the axial load

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>The peroneal nerve courses around the fibular neck and is vulnerable in its subcutaneous position</li>

        <li>Subsequently divides into the deep and superficial peroneal nerves</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      Leg has 4 compartments:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Anterior: tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus, peroneus tertius, anterior tibial vessels and
        deep peroneal nerve</li>

        <li>Lateral: peroneus longus, peroneus brevis and superficial peroneal nerve</li>

        <li>Deep posterior: flexor digitorum longus, flexor hallucis longus, tibialis anterior, posterior tibial vessels and the posterior
        tibial nerve</li>

        <li>Superficial posterior: gastrocnemius, plantaris and soleus</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      The limited soft tissue envelope around the tibia, particularly the anteromedial surface, predisposes these factures to wound
      complications

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Highly traumatized soft tissue, even in the absence of serious wounds, are poor environments for surgical wound
        healing</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      Relatively poor soft tissue vascularization around this region can complicate wound management and fracture healing

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Risk of wound complications is increased by conditions such as diabetes or peripheral vascular disease</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Gastrocnemius can be used as a muscle flap for coverage of large proximal soft tissue defects</li>

    <li>Soleus can be used for distal third defects</li>

    <li>Posterior tibial nerve function often important in selecting limb salvage over amputation in severe injuries</li>

    <li>
      Fracture pattern and mechanism:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>High-energy injuries result in transverse fractures or comminuted fractures</li>

        <li>Bending injuries result in short oblique, transverse or butterfly patterns</li>

        <li>Crush injuries result in comminution and segmental fractures</li>

        <li>Torsional injuries result in spiral fractures</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      Stress fractures

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>
          Military: commonly sustained at the metaphyseal/diaphyseal junction

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Posteromedial cortex demonstrates most bone reaction, likely due to greater soft tissue coverage</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Ballet: middle third</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>Patients typically present with pain, deformity and swelling</li>

    <li>
      High-energy mechanisms require a full trauma evaluation and resuscitation

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Given the importance of the soft tissues, understanding the mechanism of injury is important to determine extent of soft tissue
        injury, particularly when open wounds are not present</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      Assess NV status and identify associated injuries

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Up to 24% of fractures are open</li>

        <li>Fibula is not fractured in up to 22% (associated with malunion)</li>

        <li>Knee ligmament injuries are common</li>

        <li>High-energy injuries are associated with pelvic and head trauma</li>

        <li>Fracture blisters and contusions about the tibia may warrant delay of open treatment until soft tissues are more suitable for
        surgical incisions</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      Compartment syndrome: sustained increase in compartment pressure due to inflammation and edema in one or more of the leg compartments
      leading to vascular compromise and muscle death

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Muscle death occurs 6-8 hours after the onset of compartment syndrome</li>

        <li>Severe pain with passive motion of the toes/foot is often first sign</li>

        <li>
          Other signs include tense swelling of the calf, diminished pulses, pain out of proportion to injury and paresthesias

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Serial neurovascular exams are required as compartment syndrome can develop more than 24 hours after injury</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Compartment pressures should be measured in patients demonstrating clinical signs of compartment syndrome

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Compartment pressure &gt; 30 mmHg or within 30 mmHg of the diastolic blood pressure warrant urgent fasciotomies of the leg
            compartments</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Deep posterior compartment pressure may be elevated in the presence of a soft superficial compartment

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Missed posterior compartment syndrome can result in claw toe deformity</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
