    <big><b>Treatment</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>
      <b>Acute treatment</b>: dislocations and fracture-dislocations should be grossly reduced and splinted

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Reduction maneuver: longitudinal traction with pressure on the base of the MC to reverse deformity</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Thumb CMC dislocations</u>:
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Operative</b>: preferred in almost all cases to decrease instability and arthrosis

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Closed reduction and pinning does not adequately treat this injury</li>

        <li>Options include open ligament repair with pinning of the joint or early open ligament reconstruction with flexor
        carpi radialis graft</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Thumb CMC fracture-dislocations</u>:
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Operative</b>: preferred in almost all cases to decrease instability and arthrosis

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Percutaneous pinning: preferred for Bennett's and comminuted Rolando's fractures

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Following acceptable closed reduction, K-wires are passed across the MC shaft and into the adjacent 2nd MC and/or
            the trapezium</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>ORIF: indicated for less comminuted Rolando's fractures

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Fixation is achieved with screws &plusmn; plate</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Finger CMC dislocations and fracture-dislocations</u>:
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Nonoperative</b>: indicated for simple dislocations and some minimally displaced fracture-dislocations that are stable
      after reduction

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Reductions of unstable fracture-dislocations cannot be held effectively reduced with a splint</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Operative</b>: generally preferred for most injuries

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Percutaneous pinning: following acceptable closed reduction, K-wires are passed across the metacarapal shaft and into
        the adjacent stable MCs and/or the carpus</li>

        <li>ORIF: indicated for failed closed reduction or open injuries

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Stabilization can be performed with K-wires</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Reverse Bennett's fracture: often requires ORIF with wire or lag screw due to deforming forces</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>
  </ul><br />

  <div class="page-title">
    <big><b>Complications</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Compartment syndrome: rare

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Compartment pressure &gt; 15-20 mmHg warrants release of all 10 compartments</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Nerve injuries: the ulnar nerve (motor) is at risk with 5th CMC joint dislocations</li>

    <li>Posttraumatic arthritis: 2nd and 3rd CMC joints are highly amenable to arthrodesis</li>

    <li>Residual instability: can be addressed with arthrodesis

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>5th CMC can be fused in 20&deg; of flexion with little loss of hand motion</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Vascular injuries: the deep palmar arterial arch is at risk with 3rd CMC joint dislocations</li>
  </ul>
