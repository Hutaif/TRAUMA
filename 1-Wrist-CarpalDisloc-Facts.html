    <big><b>Facts</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Fractures and dislocations involving the carpus can be easily misdiagnosed as wrist sprains<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>The carpus is made up of 8 bones grouped into 2 rows

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Distal carpal row: strong ligamentous connections within the row and with the MCs form a rigid transverse arch

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Includes trapezium (articulates with 1st MC), trapezoid (2nd MC), capitate (3rd), hamate (4th and 5th)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Proximal carpal row: articulates with the radius and ulna and includes the scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Pisiform is a sesamoid of the FCU tendon and articulates only with the triquetrum</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Primary axis of rotation is through the head of the capitate</li>

    <li>In radial deviation, the scaphoid flexes, causing the entire proximal row to flex</li>

    <li>In ulnar deviation, the scaphoid extends and the proximal row extends</li>

    <li>Ligaments:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Transverse carpal ligament extends from scaphoid and trapezium to hamate and pisiform

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Forms the roof to the carpal tunnel</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Extrinsic: connect radius to carpus and carpus to MCs

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Volar ligaments stronger than dorsal</li>

            <li>Volar: radioscaphocapitate (RSC), radiolunatotriquetral (RLT), radioscaphoid, ulnocapitate, ulnotriquetral and
            ulnolunate</li>

            <li>Dorsal: radiotriquetral and scaphotriquetral</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Intrinsic: connect carpal bones to carpal bones and include the scapholunate (SL) and lunotriquetral (LT)
        ligaments</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Space of Poirier: ligament free space and potential area of weakness along proximal capitate

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Lies between the RSC and RLT ligaments</li>

        <li>Allows escape of distal carpal row from lunate in perilunate dislocations</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Midcarpal instability:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Proximal row acts as "intercalated segment", connecting radius/ulna to a rigid distal row</li>

        <li>Volar intercalated segment instability (VISI): commonly results from LT dissociation due to LT ligament injury

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Lunate flexes due to loss of support from triquetrum</li>

            <li>Scapholunate angle: &lt; 30&deg;</li>

            <li>Radiolunate angle: &gt; 15&deg; of flexion</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Dorsal intercalated segment instability (DISI): commonly due to scaphoid fracture or SL ligament injury

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Lunate extends due to loss of support from radius (via the scaphoid)</li>

            <li>Scapholunate angle: &gt; 70&deg;</li>

            <li>Radiolunate angle: &gt; 10&deg; of extension</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    </div>
  </ul>


  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC): stabilizer of ulnar carpus and DRUJ

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Attaches at the base of the styloid process</li>

        <li>Absorbs about 20% of load across wrist joint</li>

        <li>Components: meniscal homologue, articular disk, ulnocarpal ligaments (ulnolunate and ulnotriquetral) and extensor
        carpi ulnaris sheath</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Perilunate dislocations and fracture-dislocations</u>:
    </li>

    <li>Most common wrist dislocation</li>

    <li>Typically occurs after fall on an outstretched, ulnarly deviated and extended hand</li>

    <li>Represents a continuum of injury to the ligamentous connections around the lunate</li>

    <li>Lesser arc injury: energy passes around circumference of lunate and results in intrinsic ligament disruption</li>

    <li>Greater arc injury: energy passes more distally through the scaphoid, capitate and triquetrum, resulting in fractures of
    one or more of these bones

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Twice as common as lesser arc injuries</li>

        <li>Most common is the transscaphoid, perilunate fracture-dislocation (de Quervain) in which the scaphoid is
        fractured</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Distal carpal row generally dislocates dorsally<br />

      <div class="image">
        <img src="arcs.png" width="200" />
        <span>Lesser and Greater arcs</span>
      </div>
    <br /></li>

    <li>Patients present with pain, deformity and digital flexion (stage IV dislocation)</li>

    <li>Assess NV status and identify associated injuries

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Median nerve paresthesias are common with stage IV dislocations</li>

        <li>Ulnar nerve, arterial injuries and tendon injuries can also occur</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Radiocarpal fracture-dislocations</u>:
    </li>

    <li>Uncommon injury associated with high-energy trauma</li>

    <li>May occur as a pure ligamentous injury (rare) or fracture-dislocation</li>

    <li>Most common avulsion fragments include: Barton's fracture (dorsal or volar lip fracture of the distal radius),
    radiostyloid (avulsion of the RSC ligament), volar lunate facet (RL ligament) and the ulnar styloid</li>

    <li>Ulnar translation is most common<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Patients present with pain, swelling and wrist deformity if spontaneous reduction has not occurred</li>

    <li>Assess NV status and identify associated injuries

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Neurovascular compromise is common due to compression</li>

        <li>Hand ischemia warrants immediate relocation</li>

        <li>Median nerve is more commonly involved than ulnar nerve</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Scapholunate instability</u>:
    </li>

    <li>Most common ligamentous disruption in the wrist</li>

    <li>Represents injury to the scapholunate (SL) ligament, decoupling lunate and scaphoid motion

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Complete tears demonstrate widening of the SL interval on AP radiographs</li>

        <li>Scaphoid tends to flex without this constraint while the lunate extends (DISI)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>The result of stress loading of the carpus while in extension and ulnar deviation<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Patients present with swelling acutely</li>

    <li>Assess NV status and identify associated injuries</li>

    <li>Tenderness to palpation of scapholunate region is often present

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Pain is reproduced with vigorous grasp and loading activities (i.e. push ups)</li>

        <li>Watson test: pressure applied to scaphoid tubercle volarly

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Pain or a clunk elicited when wrist is brought from ulnar to radial deviation is suggestive of SL
            instability</li>

            <li>Helps diagnose dynamic scapholunate deformity</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Static deformity presents with abnormal static radiographs</li>

    <li>Dynamic deformity presents with normal radiographs but abnormal stress testing and stress radiographs<br />
    <br />
    <u>Lunotriquetral dissociation</u>:</li>

    <li>Result from disruption of the LT ligament, commonly from an axial load

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Triquetrum tends to extend without LT ligament constraint while lunate tends to flex (VISI)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Assess NV status and identify associated injuries<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Patients present with tenderness dorsally one finger breadth distal to ulnar head</li>

    <li>May demonstrate a painful clunk with wrist deviation</li>

    <li>LT shear test: dorsally directed pressure on the pisiform and volarly directed pressure on the lunate creates a shear
    force that can reproduce pain</li>
  </ul>
