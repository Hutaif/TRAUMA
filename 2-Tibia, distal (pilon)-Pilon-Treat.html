    <big><b>Treatment</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Based on age, functional status, fracture severity, articular involvement, soft tissue envelope and osteoporosis</li>

    <li>Articular reconstruction can be challenging or not possible</li>

    <li>Patients should be advised about the increased risk of posttraumatic arthritis</li>

    <li>Open wounds should be cleansed and dressed in the acute setting</li>

    <li>Acutely reduce gross displacement of the ankle with traction and reversal of deformity followed by application of a long
    leg splint (posterior with stir-up) with ankle at 90&deg;<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>
      <b>Nonoperative</b>: reserved for nondisplaced fractures and severely ill patients

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>LLC for 6 weeks with ankle at 90&deg;</li>

        <li>Closed reduction is rarely possible and loss of reduction is common</li>

        <li>Disadvantage: does not allow for soft tissue assessment</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Operative</b>: indications include displaced fractures if the articular surface is amenable to reconstruction and open
      fractures

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Goals: maintenance of fibular length and stability, restoration of the tibial articular surface, bone grafting
        metaphyseal defects and fixation of fracture fragments</li>

        <li>Delaying definitive articular fixation until soft tissues are optimized (up to 21 days in severe cases) can decrease
        the risk of wound complications

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Provisional calcaneal traction pin or external fixation of the tibia with possible ORIF of the fibula can be
            performed to maintain length</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Internal fixation</u>: low profile (decreases skin tension) medial, anterior, anterolateral and/or posterior tibial
      plates can be used in combination depending on fracture pattern

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Cancellous bone graft, demineralized bone matrix or cement to fill metaphyseal defects</li>

        <li>7-10 cm skin bridge between tibial and fibular incision is desired to avoid skin necrosis</li>

        <li>Minimally invasive percutaneous plate osteosynthesis (MIPPO) utilizes smaller incisions to slide a contoured plate
        under the soft tissue envelope along tibial metaphysis

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Percutaneous screw placement reduces surgical involvement of the soft tissues</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>External fixation</u>: appropriate for severe soft tissue compromise or open fractures

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Reduction through traction and ligamentotaxis</li>

        <li>Inclusion of foot prevents equinus deformity and eliminates soft tissue motion</li>

        <li>Alternatively, a hybrid fixator (external fixator construct proximally connected to ring fixator around an articular
        fracture) or ring fixator that excludes the foot can be used to allow early ROM</li>

        <li>Can be used as definitive treatment if adequate reduction is achieved</li>

        <li>External fixation with plate fixation of the fibula may be susceptible to varus malalignment</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul><br />

    <big><b>Complications</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Compartment syndrome: up to 5%

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Require urgent fasciotomies to release pressure and avoid muscle death</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Infection: associated with open injuries and soft tissue devitalization

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Osteomyelitis: can develop in patients with significant wound complications</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Malunion: commonly due to nonanatomic reduction, inadequate buttressing followed by collapse, or premature
    weight-bearing</li>

    <li>Nonunion (5%): increased risk with high comminution, bone loss or infection

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Lack of union at 12 weeks warrants bone grafting</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Posttraumatic arthritis: a consequence of any articular injury, can be theoretically minimized with anatomic reduction

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Arthrodesis can be performed as a salvage procedure</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Stiffness: due to posttraumatic fibrosis and arthrosis</li>

    <li>Wound complications: common

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Highest for R&uuml;edi-Allg&ouml;wer type 3 injuries</li>

        <li>Delayed surgical treatment to allow for soft tissue optimization, closing skin without tension and meticulous soft
        tissue technique is believed to reduce this risk</li>

        <li>Secondary skin grafts and/or flaps may be necessary for adequate closure</li>
