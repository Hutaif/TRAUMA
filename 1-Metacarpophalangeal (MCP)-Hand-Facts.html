    <big><b>Facts</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Fractures are commonly work related, due to either direct blow or a fall

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Border digits most commonly involved</li>

        <li>Phalangeal fractures twice as common as metacarpal (MC)</li>

        <li>Proximal phalanx most common, followed by distal</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Dislocations of the interphalangeal (IP) joints are commonly due to ball sports and primarily dorsal</li>

    <li>Dislocations of the metacarpalphalangeal (MCP) joints are usually dorsal<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Extensor digitorum communis (EDC) extends the MCP and IP joints, attaching via three slips:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Sagittal bands: arise from the volar plate and centralize the EDC over the MCP joint

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>EDC extends MCP via the sagittal bands</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Central slip: EDC attachment to the dorsum of the middle phalanx</li>

        <li>Lateral bands: continuation of the EDC that inserts on the base of the distal phalanx</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) inserts on the base of the distal phalanx</li>

    <li>Flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) bifurcates around the FDP and inserts on the base of the middle phalanx</li>

    <li>Flexor tendons travel through a sheath that protects, lubricates and nourishes

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Pulleys: aponeurotic bands along the volar surface provide a mechanical advantage and prevent bowstringing

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>A1, A3 and A5 are volar to the MCP, PIP and DIP respectively</li>

            <li>A2 and A4 are volar to the proximal and middle phalanges (most important mechanically)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Extensor tendons do not have a sheath</li>

        <li>Patients presenting after a puncture injury can develop an infection of the flexor tendon sheath (infectious
        tenosynovitis)

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>These patients classicaly present with Kanavel's cardinal signs:

              <ol>
                <li>Flexed posture</li>

                <li>Fusiform swelling along digit</li>

                <li>Tenderness to percussion</li>

                <li>Pain with passive extension of the digit</li>
              </ol>
            </li>

            <li>Presence of these four signs warrants open irrigation and debridement</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Lumbricals arise from the FDP and insert on the extensor expansion/lateral bands of the EDC

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Flexes the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) through its insertion distal to the MCP</li>

        <li>Extends proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints through its insertion on the lateral bands</li>

        <li>Only muscle that inserts on its own antagonist</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Interossei arise from the MC and insert on the extensor expansion

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Palmar interossei adduct while dorsal interossei abduct the digits</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Extrinisic muscles arise in the forearm and insert within the hand

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>These include the EDC, FDS and FDP</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Intrinsic muscles: arise and insert within the hand

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>These include the lumbricals and interossei</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Volar plate: fibrocartilaginous sheet that forms the floor of the IP and MCP joints</li>

    <li>Hand compartments: dorsal interossei (4), palmar interossei (3), adductor pollicis, thenar and hypothenar<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Patients often present with deformity and swelling</li>

    <li>Pertinent patient information includes: age, hand dominance, occupation, systemic illnesses, nature of injury, time of
    injury (relevant for open injuries), exposure to contamination, work related injury</li>

    <li>Assess NV status and identify associated injuries</li>

    <li>Compartment syndrome: sustained increase in compartment pressure due to inflammation and edema in one or more of the hand
    compartments leading to vascular compromise and muscle death

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Signs include tense swelling, pain out of proportion to injury and loss of motion</li>

        <li>Sensory exam may be normal</li>

        <li>Hand may assume intrinsic minus position (MCP extension, IP flexion)</li>

        <li>Compartment pressures must be measured when clinical signs of compartment syndrome are present</li>

        <li>Pressure &gt; 15-20 mmHg warrants release of all 10 compartments

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Transverse carpal ligament requires release as well</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Metacarpal</u>:
    </li>

    <li>Unlike phalanges, have unicondular head</li>

    <li>Deep transverse ligament limits translation of the middle digit MCs</li>

    <li>Due to interossei, most neck and shaft fractures angulate apex dorsal</li>

    <li>Proper rotational reduction can be confirmed by evaluating the digit cascade

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>With the forearm upright, the digits fall into passive flexion</li>

        <li>All digits should point towards the scaphoid</li>

        <li>Compare overlap with uninjured side</li>

        <li>Excess overlap indicates malrotation</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Metacarpophalangeal joint</u>
    </li>

    <li>Fingers:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Ulnar and radial collateral ligaments are primary stabilizers

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Tighter in flexion than extension</li>

            <li>Volar plate stabilizes the volar aspect</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>The MCP is weakest dorsally, thus in most dislocations the proximal phalanx displaces dorsally</li>

        <li>MC head may buttonhole volarly between the natatory ligament and the superficial transverse MC ligament preventing
        reduction</li>

        <li>Irreducible dislocations can also result when volar plate becomes incarcerated within the joint (volar plate remains
        attached to proximal phalanx)</li>

        <li>Stress testing should be performed in flexion, when collateral ligaments are on stretch</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Thumb:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) is crucial for function (pincer grasp)

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Skier's or Gamekeeper's thumb: acute injury to the UCL</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Stener lesion: adductor pollicis aponeurosis interposition between the two ends of a ruptured UCL can prevent healing

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Can be diagnosed by a tender, palpable mass over the UCL</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Thumb MCP has sesmoids embedded in the volar plate

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Flexor pollicis brevis (FPB) and abductor policis brevis partially insert on the sesamoids</li>

            <li>Presence of a sesamoid within a widened thumb MCP joint is pathognomonic for an irreducible joint</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Proximal phalanx</u>
    </li>

    <li>Anatomic regions: head, neck, shaft and base</li>

    <li>Bicondylar head</li>

    <li>Fractures tend to deform apex volar</li>

    <li>Complex extensor mechanism surrounds this bone and must be considered during surgical approaches<br />
    <br />
    <u>Proximal interphalangeal joint</u></li>

    <li>Collateral ligament and volar plate disruptions are common</li>

    <li>Central slip injury can result in a Boutonni&egrave;re deformity if not treated</li>

    <li>Evaluate extensor mechanism with active extension from a flexed position</li>

    <li>Dislocations my be irreducible due to volar plate or flexor tendon incarceration<br />
    <br />
    <u>Middle phalanx</u></li>

    <li>Anatomic regions: head, neck, shaft and base</li>

    <li>Central slip attaches dorsally at the base</li>

    <li>FDS attaches along volar surface</li>

    <li>Distal fractures tend to angulate apex volar</li>

    <li>Proximal fracture tend to angulate apex dorsal<br />
    <br />
    <u>Distal and thumb interphalangeal joint</u></li>

    <li>Bicondylar joint that is stabilized by collateral ligaments

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Dynamic balance between flexor and extensor tendons provide additional stability</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Transverse wounds along the volar skin crease are common and require evaluation and treatment</li>

    <li>Irreducible dislocations can occur for various reasons:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Dorsal: incarceration of the volar plate or buttonholing of the middle phalanx through the FDP</li>

        <li>Volar: incarceration of the extensor tendon</li>

        <li>Thumb: incarceration of the sesamoids or volar plate</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Distal phalanx</u>
    </li>

    <li>Most offten fractured in a crush or axial load</li>

    <li>Anatomic regions: tuft (distal), shaft and base</li>

    <li>Fractures often also have nailbed injuries that require repair</li>
