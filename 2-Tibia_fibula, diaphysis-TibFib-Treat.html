    <big><b>Treatment</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>
      Damage control orthopedics: in polytrauma patients, initial interventions should provide expedient stabilization of long bone and pelvic
      fractures (e.g. external fixation)

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Definitive procedures should be delayed until the patient's general condition has stabilized</li>

        <li>Minimizes the "second hit" associated with physiological burden of surgery in patients at risk of multi-organ failure and acute
        respiratory distress</li>

        <li>Patients at risk typically demonstrate hemodynamic instability, difficult resuscitation, polytrauma, coagulopathy and
        hypothermia</li>

        <li>Immunological markers such as IL-6 can be used to monitor inflammatory response of at risk patients</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Acceptable alignment</b>:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>&lt; 5&deg; of varus/valgus</li>

        <li>&lt; 5&deg;-10&deg; of anterior/posterior angulation</li>

        <li>&lt; 5&deg; of rotational deformity (ER is better tolerated)</li>

        <li>&lt; 1 cm shortening (5 mm of distraction can delay healing by 8-12 months)</li>

        <li>&gt; 50% cortical contact</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Nonoperative</b>: indicated for minimal soft tissue injury (low-energy mechanisms) and fractures in acceptable alignment

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Nonoperative treatment associated with lower rate of infection but operative treatment associated with higher rate of union at 20
        weeks</li>

        <li>Reduction can be performed with general anesthesia or conscious sedation</li>

        <li>Initially place LLC with 30&deg; of knee flexion to prevent weight-bearing, ankle at 90&deg;</li>

        <li>Weight-bearing can be advanced based on stability/comminution of fracture, degree of healing</li>

        <li>Cast can then be replaced with knee at 0&deg;-5&deg; to allow for weight-bearing</li>

        <li>Patellar tendon-bearing cast or functional brace can be applied after swelling has subsided</li>

        <li>Total immobilization time depends on status of healing/union</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Operative</b>: indications include high-energy fracture, unacceptable alignment, compartment syndrome, open fracture, ipsilateral
      femoral fracture or intact fibula (relative)

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Acutely cleanse and dress any open wounds in anticipation of thorough open irrigation and debridement in the OR</li>

        <li>Apply long leg posterior splint acutely to minimize further soft tissue injury in anticipation of surgery</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>External fixation</u>: primarily used to treat open fractures, fractures complicated by compartment syndrome and patients with canal diameters &lt; 6 mm (higher rate of
      intramedullary nail failure)

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Allows for continuing wound care</li>

        <li>10% incidence of pin tract infections (most common complication)</li>

        <li>Union rates of 85-95% with definitive external fixation</li>

        <li>Can be transitioned to definitive IM nail within 2 weeks</li>

        <li>Increased risk of infection when transition to definitive intramedullary nail is performed &gt; 2 weeks after placement of external
        fixator</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Plate fixation</u>: indications include patients with canal diameters &lt; 6 mm, knee replacements and fractures extending into the metaphysis or epiphysis

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Historically high risk of wound complications</li>

        <li>Led to recent development of percutaneous techniques</li>

        <li>Locking plates provide better fixation in osteoporotic bone</li>

        <li>May be applied along medial (subcutaneous) or lateral (submuscular) tibia</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Intramedullary nailing</u>: generally preferred for most fractures

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Allows preservation of periosteal blood supply, minimizes soft tissue damage, provides control of alignment and permits
        weight-bearing</li>

        <li>Contraindications: gross canal contamination, canal deformity, knee replacement or arthrodesis, canal diameters &lt; 6
        mm</li>

        <li>
          Locked: provides rotational control and prevents shortening in presence of comminution

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Locking screws can be removed later to dynamize and encourage healing</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Unlocked: allows impaction of the fracture with weight-bearing for select transverse and short oblique fracture
        patterns</li>

        <li>
          Reaming: generally believed to shorten time to union and lower incidence of nonunion

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Allows uniform enlargement of the intramedullary canal</li>

            <li>Advantage: allows for proper implant sizing, produces bone graft that may augment fracture healing, allows insertion of larger
            nail and thus more rigid fixation</li>

            <li>Disadvantage: disrupts endosteal blood supply, increased risk for fat embolism</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Unreamed: preserves the endosteal blood supply in open fractures where the periosteal supply has been disrupted</li>

        <li>While reaming has a demonstrated advantage in clinical outcomes for closed tibial shaft fractures, this is not true for open
        fractures</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      Tibial stess fracture:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Activity modification or SLC and PWB for 6-10 weeks if necessary</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      Fibular fracture:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>WBAT without immobilization or LLC based on symptoms</li>

        <li>Nonunion is uncommon due to extensive muscular attachments</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      Fasciotomy:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Compartment pressure &gt; 30 mmHg or within 30 mmHg of the diastolic blood pressure warrants urgent fasciotomies of the leg
        compartments (anterior, lateral, deep/superficial posterior)</li>

        <li>
          Can be performed through two incisions

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Anterolateral allows release of the anterior and lateral compartments</li>

            <li>Medial incision allows release of the superficial and deep posterior compartments</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul><br />

  <div class="page-title">
    <big><b>Complications</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>
      Compartment syndrome (8%): lower age is an independent risk factor

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Urgent fasciotomy is indicated to release compartment pressure and maintain muscle
        viability</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      Delayed union: defined as absence of healing at 20 weeks

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Can be treated with bone grafting, dynamization of a locked nail (remove distal screws to allow fracture
        compression with weight-bearing) or exchange nailing with a larger nail</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Hardware failure: screw breakage after nail placement is associated with unreamed nails (smaller diameter thus
    smaller interlocks)</li>

    <li>
      Infection: &lt; 5% of closed fractures

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Generally associated with plate fixation, grade II and III open fractures</li>

        <li>Infections involving the fracture site will lead to nonunion</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Knee/ankle stiffness: due to prolonged immobilization (ankle more susceptible)</li>

    <li>
      Knee pain: most common complication following IM nailing, occuring in &gt; 50%

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Unclear etiology but can be due to nail prominence</li>

        <li>Resolves in 50% after nail removal</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Malunion: associated with nonoperative treatment, external fixation, intact fibula and intramedullary nail treatment
    of proximal third tibia fractures</li>

    <li>
      Neurovascular injury:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Anterior tibial artery is most at risk as it passes through the interosseous membrane</li>

        <li>Popliteal artery can be injured during placement of a proximal anteroposterior IM nail
        interlock</li>

        <li>Common peroneal nerve as it curves around fibular neck</li>

        <li>Deep peroneal nerve is at risk during placement of external fixator pins or proximal IM nail
        interlocks</li>

        <li>Sural and saphenous nerves are at risk during placement of distal IM nail interlocks</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      Nonunion: associated with open fractures (grade III), infection, nonoperative treatment and external
      fixation

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Nonunion can be identified radiographically at 36 weeks when bone ends become sclerotic in the absence of
        bridging bone</li>

        <li>Can be treated with cancellous bone graft exchange nailing with a larger nail</li>
      </ul>
