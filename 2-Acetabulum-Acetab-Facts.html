  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Latin for a small cup used to store vinegar</li>

    <li>Fractures occur primarily in young adults, resulting from high-energy mechanisms such as MVC and high velocity falls</li>

    <li>Geriatric acetabular fractures are typically low-energy falls<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Acetabulum is formed by the confluence of the ilium, ischium and pubis within the innominate bone</li>

    <li>Quadrilateral plate forms the medial wall</li>

    <li>40% of femoral head is covered by the acetabulum</li>

    <li>Hip joint has inherent stability due to bony and soft tissue anatomy

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Fibrocartilanginous labrum deepens the acetabulum, increasing coverage and stability</li>

        <li>Thick capsule and ligaments (iliofemoral, pubofemoral and ischiofemoral) provide further support</li>

        <li>Soft tissue structures including the labrum, iliofemoral ligament, capsule, bony fragments and tendons (piriformis,
        psoas) can prevent closed reduction</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Fracture pattern determined by position of the femoral head and direction of applied force<br /></li>

    <li>Two column concept:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Anterior column (iliopubic): extends from the iliac crest to the pubic symphysis and includes the anterior half of
        the acetabulum</li>

        <li>Posterior column (ilioischial): extends from the greater sciatic notch to the ischial tuberosity and includes the
        posterior half of the acetabulum</li>

        <li>Acetabulum often described as an inverted Y

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Anterior column/iliopubic segment forms anterior limb</li>

            <li>Posterior column/ilioischial segment forms posterior limb</li>

            <li>The arch between the limbs forms the roof of the acetabulum</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>Patients typically present after high-energy trauma</li>

    <li>A full trauma resuscitation and evaluation should be performed

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Up to 50% are associated with other injuries including cranial, chest and abdominal</li>

        <li>Life threatening injuries are first priority</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Soft tissues warrant close inspection for abrasions and local wounds

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Morel-Lavall&eacute;e lesion: internal degloving injury leading to a serosanguinous fluid filled cavity

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Affected area (usually over the greater trochanter) demonstrates swelling, fluctuance and ecchymosis</li>

            <li>Associated with a high rate of infection (up to 33%)</li>

            <li>Requires aggressive debridement and drainage</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Position of the affected extremity can suggest anterior dislocation (abduction, ER), posterior dislocation (adduction,
    flexion, IR) or other ipsilateral fractures (shortening)</li>

    <li>Assess NV status of the pelvis and the lower extremities

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Sciatic nerve injuries occur in up to 20% of posterior column or wall fractures

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Peroneal division is more commonly affected than tibial (test tibialis anterior, EHL and peroneals)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Other musculoskeletal injuries are common

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Dashboard injuries typically result in posterior wall fractures

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Note injuries to knee including joint instability and patellar fractures</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Pelvic fractures are present in up to 20% of cases</li>

        <li>Presence of femoral shaft fractures can affect operative management</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
