    <big><b>Treatment</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Surgical treatment results in significantly improved ROM, knee function and reduced contractures compared to nonoperative
    treatment<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>
      <b>Closed reduction</b>: immediate reduction should be performed upon presentation with axial traction and translation to
      reverse deformity

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Splint knee in 20&deg;-30&deg; of flexion</li>

        <li>Dislocations with a rotational component may require open reduction due to buttonholing of the femoral condyle
        through the knee capsule</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Nonoperative</b>: may be indicated for morbid obesity, sedentary lifestyle, low demand elderly patients or patients with
      ACL/MCL injuries and minimal posterior laxity (intact PCL)

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Closed reduction followed by a short period of immobilization with early ROM and physical therapy</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Operative</b>: indications include failed closed reduction, soft tissue interposition, open or vascular injuries

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Knee spanning external fixation is required for vascular repair (typically saphoneous vein graft from contralateral
        leg) or open dislocations

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>High amputation rates for vascular repair delayed &gt; 8 hours</li>

            <li>Vascular repair delays &gt; 6 hours should undergo leg fasciotomy</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Examine knee ligaments under anesthesia if possible</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Subacute repair of knee ligaments</b>:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>In general, early surgical intervention (&lt; 4 weeks) followed by aggressive rehabilitation to prevent
        arthrofibrosis is advocated</li>

        <li>Large bony avulsion fragments benefit from acute (&lt; 1 week) fixation</li>

        <li>Multi-ligament injury with disruption to the lateral structures (LCL, popliteus, lateral capsule, popliteofibular
        ligament) warrants treatment within 2 weeks (before the onset of significant scarring)</li>

        <li>ACL tears with intact PCL: delayed reconstruction (6 weeks) of the ACL to allow early ROM appears to decrease
        arthrofibrosis</li>

        <li>PCL tears with intact ACL: early reconstruction of the PCL appears to be advantageous</li>

        <li>Both ACL and PCL tears: early reconstruction of both or staged PCL then ACL is generally recommended</li>

        <li>Injuries to the posteromedial or posterolateral corners warrant repair or reconstruction in most cases</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul><br />

    <big><b>Complications</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Compartment syndrome: requires urgent fasciotomy to release pressure and avoid muscle death</li>

    <li>Heterotopic ossification (26-43%): correlated with Injury Severity Score</li>

    <li>Knee stiffness: most common

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Due to scarring and capsular tightness</li>

        <li>Lysis of adhesions may be performed</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Ligamentous laxity: uncommon after adequate immobilization and reconstruction</li>

    <li>Peroneal nerve injury (10-40%): recovery rates reported around 35%</li>

    <li>Vascular disruption (10-65%)</li>
