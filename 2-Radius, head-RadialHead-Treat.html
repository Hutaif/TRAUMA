    <big><b>Treatment</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Consider joint aspiration to relieve discomfort and facilitate examination of ROM

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Identify the triangle formed by the lateral epicondyle, lateral olecranon and the radial head</li>

        <li>The soft spot in the center of this triangle is your entry point for aspiration (anconeus then capsule then joint
        space)</li>

        <li>Injection of local anesthetic can facilitate exam</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Operative treatment</b>:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Open reduction through a Kocher (lateral) incision or a posterior incision</li>

        <li>Fixation with miniature lag screws, differential pitch screws (e.g. Herbert) or bioabsorbable pins</li>

        <li>Fractures deemed not reconstructable can be replaced with metalic implants</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li><b>Treatment by injury</b>:<br />
    <u>Mason I</u>:</li>
	<ul class="second-level">
    <li>Symptomatic: sling, early ROM (&lt; 7 days) and protected weight-bearing for 6 weeks<br />
    <br />
	</ul>
    <u>Mason II</u>:</li>
	<ul class="second-level">
    <li>If supination/pronation is limited, aspirate joint followed by injection of local anesthetic to assess mechanical block

      <ul class="third-level">
        <li>If no mechanical block: symptomatic treatment with sling and early ROM per Mason I</li>

        <li>If mechanical block: ORIF

          <div type="disc">
            - If fragment is too small for stable fixation (roughly &lt; 25% of the articular surface area), excision of
            fragment is appropriate</li>
          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Displacement &gt; 2 mm with associated elbow instability warrants ORIF<br />
    <br />
	</ul>
    <u>Mason III</u>:</li>
	<ul class="second-level">
    <li>Fractures without mechanical block, associated fractures (e.g. coronoid) or instability can be considered for nonsurgical
    treatment per Mason I</li>

    <li>If a mechanical block exists, the radial head must be fixed or excised and replaced</li>

    <li>Replacement is indicated for displaced, comminuted fractures when reconstruction of at least 50% of the articular surface
    area is not feasible

      <ul class="third-level">
        <li>Replacement of the radial head appears to produce the best results</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Excision alone is associated with late complications and is contraindicated in cases with concomitant MCL or IOM injury

      <ul class="third-level">
        <li>Reserved for elderly, low demand patients</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Ligamentous injuries must be addressed simultaneously to restore stability (as per terrible triad below)<br />
    <br />
	</ul>
    <u>Mason IV</u>:</li>
	<ul class="second-level">
    <li>Treat dislocation acutely (see Elbow Dislocation chapter) and radial head fracture per above<br />
    <br />
	</ul>
	
    <u>Terrible Triad</u>: see Elbow Dislocation chapter for more information</li>
	<ul class="second-level">
    <li>
      <b>Nonoperative</b>: indicated for concentric reduction, stability at 30&deg; of flexion or less, minimally displaced radial
      head fracture (by CT) without block to rotation and Type I coronoid (by CT)

      <ul class="third-level">
        <li>Immobilize in splint or cast for 7-10 days followed by early ROM</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Operative</b>: generally preferred

      <ul class="third-level">
        <li>Usually through a posterior incision</li>

        <li>Fix coronoid fracture with sutures (Type I/II) or screw (Type III)</li>

        <li>Fix or replace radial head as described above</li>

        <li>Repair LCL to lateral epicondyle with suture anchors or drill holes</li>

        <li>MCL may need to be repaired if instability persists after coronoid and lateral repair</li>

        <li>An external fixator may be required for residual instability</li>

        <li>Immobilize for 7-10 days followed by early ROM</li>
      </ul><br />
	</ul>
	
      <u>Essex-Lopresti lesion</u>:
    </li>
	<ul class="second-level">
    <li>Reduce DRUJ with full supination of the forearm</li>

    <li>Percutaneous pinning of the DRUJ for 3-4 weeks can be used to maintain reduction</li>

    <li>Fix or replace radial head as described above</li>

    <li>Avoid silastic prostheses (prone to mechanical failure) and radial head excision (further destabilizes radius
    longitudinally)</li>

    <li>Repair of the TFCC and IOM may be necessary in the non-acute setting</li>
  </ul>
  </ul><br />

  <div class="page-title">
    <big><b>Complications</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Posttraumatic arthritis: a consequence of any articular injury, can be theoretically minimized with anatomic reduction

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Associated with prosthetic replacements</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Elbow stiffness: associated with prolonged immobilization</li>

    <li>Essex-Lopresti: chronic wrist pain may represent unrecognized intraosseous membrane injury</li>

    <li>Posterior interosseous nerve injury: as a result of operative treatment

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Reduce of injury by performing lateral approach with forearm pronated</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Radial head resection: can lead to joint instability, proximal radial translation, cubitus valgus, elbow and wrist
    pain</li>

    <li>Reflex sympathetic dystrophy: can develop after surgical management</li>

    <li>Unrecognized dislocation: may lead to persistent instability and late redislocation</li>
