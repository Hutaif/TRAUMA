  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Rare injury that is classically associated with horseback riding where violent knee twisting can occur (e.g. foot stuck
    in stirrup while falling off horse)</li>

    <li>Proximal tibiofibular joint (PTFJ) dislocations are rarely an isolated injury, usually occur as part of other lower
    extremity injuries (e.g. posterior hip dislocations)</li>

    <li>Dislocations usually occur with knee flexed<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Located along the posterolateral surface of the proximal tibia</li>

    <li>The common peroneal nerve courses around the proximal fibular neck approximately 3 cm inferior to the knee joint
    line</li>

    <li>Inherently stable joint: fibular head is seated in a groove with strong ligamentous support

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Joint can have a horizontal or oblique orientation

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Oblique: defined as &gt; 20&deg; of inclination to horizontal, is more constrained and thus is at higher risk of
            dislocation</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Joint capsule: anterior is thicker than posterior</li>

        <li>Posterior tibiofibular ligament: extends from fibular head to posterior tibial condyle</li>

        <li>LCL: provides additional support in knee extension</li>

        <li>Popliteus: reinforces posterior tibiofibular ligament</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Bears approximately 1/6 of the weight in the leg<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Patient presents with lateral knee pain</li>

    <li>High-energy mechanisms require a full trauma evaluation and resuscitation</li>

    <li>Assess NV status and identify associated injuries</li>

    <li>Patients typically demonstrate tenderness to palpation over the fibular head</li>

    <li>Topography of lateral knee may be visibly different from contralateral, uninjured side and comparison of landmarks may be
    useful in diagnosis</li>
  </ul>
