    <big><b>Facts</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Isolated injuries are rare</li>

    <li>Can occur after simple twisting of the ankle or after high-energy injury</li>

    <li>Commonly injured as part of Lisfranc or talonavicular joint dislocation<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Articulates with calcaneus proximally, navicular and lateral cuneiform medially and 4th/5th MTs distally

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Longitudinal plantar ligament supports calcaneocuboid joint</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Peroneus longus runs plantar to the cuboid (where fracture callus can irritate)</li>

    <li>Two column concept: structural description of the foot

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Medial: 1st, 2nd and 3rd MTs, the 3 cuneiforms, navicular and talus</li>

        <li>Lateral: 4th and 5th MTs, cuboid and calcaneus</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Nutcracker injury: torsional stress or forefoot abduction causes compression between MTs and anterior process of the
    calcaneus</li>

    <li>Stress fractures can occur, particularly in athletes</li>

    <li>Untreated cuboid fracture: lateral column of the foot can shorten and destabilize, resulting in pes planus (flatfoot
    deformity) and altered weight-bearing of the foot<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Patients present with pain in the lateral foot with variable ecchymosis and swelling</li>

    <li>Assess NV status and identify associated injuries</li>

    <li>Often associated with talonavicular joint and Lisfranc injuries</li>
  </ul>
