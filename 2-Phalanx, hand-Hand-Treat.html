        <li>Most commonly involves MCP joint</li>

        <li>Bacterial inoculation occurs with tooth penetration of a closed fist</li>

        <li>When the first is opened, bacteria are dragged through the full excursion of the tendon into the dorsum of the
        hand</li>

        <li>Late presentations and obvious infections require open debridement</li>

        <li>Acute presentations require wound irrigation and close monitoring</li>

          <b>General fracture treatment principles</b>:

          <ul class="second-level">
            <li>Simple fractures should be reduced under digital or hematoma block</li>

            <li>Reductions can typically be achieved with longitudinal traction and pressure to reverse the deformity</li>

            <li>Stable fractures in acceptable alignment: generally candidates for nonoperative treatment

              <ul class="third-level">
                <li>Fingers: buddy tape (middle/distal phalanx), finger splint (phalanx) or forearm-based splint (metapcarpal)

                  <div type="disc">
                    - Maintain splint in protected position (intrinsic plus): 0&deg; of P/DIP flexion, 70&deg; of MCP flexion, 20&deg; of
                    wrist extension<br />
                    - Minimizes stiffness by placing intrinsics in maximal stretch during immobilization

                <li>Thumb: spica splint</li>

      <ul class="top-level">
        <li>Joint stiffness: associated with all dislocations as well as plate and screw fixation and prolonged immobilization

          <ul class="second-level">
            <li>High-energy injuries with comminution and intraarticular involvement predispose to stiffness</li>

            <li>Reduce risk with early mobilization and with splinting in the protected position (70&deg; of flexion at MCP)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Malunion: rotational, angular deformities, especially of the 2nd and 3rd MCs may result in functional and cosmetic
        disturbance</li>

        <li>Nonunion: transverse MC fractures treated with plate fixation are at highest risk

          <ul class="second-level">
            <li>Lag screw fixation may increase healing rate</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Percutaneous pin fixation: infection (7%), pin loosening (5%) and nonunion (4%)</li>

        <li>Residual instability: associated with fracture-dislocations</li>
      </ul>
