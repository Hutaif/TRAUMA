    <big><b>Facts</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Usually the result of a direct blow, MVC or falls</li>

    <li>Isolated radius fractures are rare<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Radial bow is critical to allow for supination and pronation</li>

    <li>Interosseous membrane (IOM) is important for longitudinal stability

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Fibrous band that connects the radius to the ulna along most of their length</li>

        <li>Separates the dorsal and volar forearm compartments</li>

        <li>Middle third is the strongest</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Radial fractures between the supinator and pronator teres insertions cause supination of the proximal fragment

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Radial fractures distal to both result in neutral rotation</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Monteggia lesion: fracture of proximal ulna with radial head dislocation

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Usually result from a fall on an outstretched hand with a flexed and pronated elbow</li>

        <li>Increased risk of radial or posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) injuries

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>PIN is the deep motor branch of the radial nerve and supplies all the wrist extensors other than the ECRL</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Nightstick fracture: isolated diaphyseal ulna fracture from trauma to the subcutaneous border</li>

    <li>Distal third radius fractures must be evaluated for distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) injuries</li>

    <li>Galeazzi fracture: fracture of the radius between middle and distal third with associated DRUJ and IOM disruption

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Three times more common than Monteggia lesion</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Reverse Galeazzi: fracture of the distal ulna with associated DRUJ disruption</li>

    <li>Compartment syndrome: sustained increase in compartment pressure due to inflammation and edema in forearm compartments
    leading to vascular compromise and muscle death

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Signs include pain out of proportion to injury, tense forearm compartments, pain with passive extension or flexion of
        the digits, diminished pulses</li>

        <li>Elevate arm and avoid hyperflexion of elbow</li>

        <li>Serial neurovascular checks for at risk arms</li>

        <li>Compartment pressure &gt; 30 mmHg or within 30 mmHg of the diastolic blood pressure warrants urgent fasciotomy of
        volar and dorsal compartments as well as carpal tunnel</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>Patients present with pain, swelling, deformity, tenderness to palpation and loss of function of the forearm and
    hand</li>

    <li>Diagnosis is generally straightforward as nondisplaced fractures are relatively uncommon</li>

    <li>Assess NV status and identify associated injuries</li>

    <li>Monteggia fractures at risk for PIN injury

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>PIN can be tested by examining extension of the thumb (EPL) and digits (EDC) with the wrist in neutral</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Galeazzi fracture patients typically present with wrist pain that is exacerbated by stressing the DRUJ

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Radial head reduction must be verified</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
