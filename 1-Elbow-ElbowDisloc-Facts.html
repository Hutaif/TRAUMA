    <big><b>Facts</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Posterior dislocation is most common, often due to a fall on an outstretched hand</li>

    <li>The result of either valgus posterolateral rotatory force, varus posteromedial rotatory force or direct blow to a flexed
    elbow</li>
	<li>Approximately 50% of acute elbow dislocations are sports related<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Proximal ulna has two articulations: the greater sigmoid notch (trochlea) and the lesser sigmoid notch (radial head)</li>

    <li>Radial head is an important secondary stabilizer of the elbow to valgus stress and posterior translation</li>

    <li>Coronoid process acts as an anterior buttress and is vital to stability of the elbow

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Sublime tubercle (medial coronoid): is the insertion of the anterior bundle of the medial collateral ligament
        (MCL)</li>

        <li>Fractures of the coronoid involving the anteromedial facet result from varus posteromedial rotation during axial
        loading

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Associated with LCL injury and instability</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Supinator crest (lateral ulna): insertion of the lateral ulnar collateral ligament (LUCL)</li>

    <li>Lateral aspect of the radial head is not covered by cartilage because it does not articulate with anything</li>

    <li>Lateral collateral ligament (LCL) consists of the radial collateral ligament, the LUCL and the annular ligament

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Provides varus and posterolateral rotatory stability</li>

        <li>LUCL is most important</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>MCL consists of the anterior and posterior bundle as well as the transverse ligament

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Provides valgus and posteromedial rotatory stability</li>

        <li>Anterior bundle most important and is the last structure ruptured</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>ROM: 0&deg;-150&deg; flexion, 85&deg; supination, 80&deg; pronation

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Functional motion: 20&deg;-120&deg; of flexion, 70&deg; of pronation and supination</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Terrible triad: posterior dislocation with radial head and coronoid fracture

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Associated with high risk of elbow instability</li>

        <li>LCL is almost always avulsed from the distal humerus leaving a "bare spot"</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>Patients present with elbow pain and deformity</li>

    <li>Assess NV status and identify associated injuries, particularly elbow fractures

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>NV injury is rare

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Median and ulnar nerves are most commonly injured</li>

            <li>Brachial artery is most common vascular injury</li>

            <li>If perfusion remains poor after reduction, vascular compromise should be suspected and angiography performed</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Compartment syndrome: sustained increase in compartment pressure due to inflammation and edema in forearm compartments
    leading to vascular compromise and muscle death

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Signs include pain out of proportion to injury, tense forearm compartments, pain with passive extension or flexion of
        the digits, diminished pulses</li>

        <li>Severe antecubital swelling may indicate impending forearm compartment syndrome</li>

        <li>Elevate arm and avoid hyperflexion of elbow</li>

        <li>Serial NV checks for at risk arms</li>

        <li>Compartment pressure &gt; 30 mmHg or within 30 mmHg of diastolic blood pressure warrants urgent fasciotomy of the
        volar and dorsal compartments to release pressure and avoid muscle death</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
