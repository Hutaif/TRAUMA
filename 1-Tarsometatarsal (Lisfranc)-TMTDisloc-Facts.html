    <big><b>Facts</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Tarsometatarsal articulation is known as the Lisfranc joint</li>

    <li>20% of these injuries are missed in polytrauma patients</li>

    <li>Most commonly due to axial loading of a plantarflexed foot<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Lisfranc joint represents border between midfoot and forefoot</li>

    <li>Undergoes only slight motion: 10&deg;-20&deg;

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>4th and 5th metatarsocuboid joints have more movement than the 1st, 2nd and 3rd tarsometatarsal joints</li>

        <li>This motion is important for normal foot mechanics</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Base of the 2nd MT is wider dorsally and recessed between medial and lateral cuneiform

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Confers inherent stability</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Trapezoidal cross-section of the middle three MTs prevents plantar displacement and forms a transverse arch for which the
    2nd MT is the keystone</li>

    <li>Strong ligamentous connections between MTs and tarsal bones

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Plantar ligaments are stronger</li>

        <li>2nd-5th MTs are connected by intermetatarsal ligaments</li>

        <li>1st and 2nd MTs are not connected</li>

        <li>Most important is the Lisfranc ligament which attaches the plantar aspect of the medial cuneiform to the base of the
        2nd MT</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Two column concept: structural description of the foot

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Medial: 1st, 2nd and 3rd MTs, the 3 cuneiforms, navicular and talus</li>

        <li>Lateral: 4th and 5th MTs, cuboid and calcaneus</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Foot compartments:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Medial: abductor hallucis, flexor hallucis brevis</li>

        <li>Interosseous: 7 interossei muscles</li>

        <li>Central superficial: flexor digitorum brevis, adductor hallucis, lumbricals</li>

        <li>Central deep (calcaneal): quadratus plantae</li>

        <li>Lateral: flexor digiti minimi brevis, abductor digiti minimi, opponens digiti minimi</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Dorsalis pedis artery dives between the 1st and 2nd MT bases and is at risk for injury</li>

    <li>Injuries often due to twisting, crush or axial loading<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Patients complain of midfoot pain and demonstrate swelling and tenderness to palpation over the midfoot/forefoot
    junction</li>

    <li>High-energy mechanisms warrant a full trauma evaluation and resuscitation</li>

    <li>Spontaneous reduction prior to presentation may occur</li>

    <li>Plantar ecchymosis suggests ligamentous injury</li>

    <li>Passive ROM of the digits may elicit pain at the tarsometatarsal joint</li>

    <li>Assess NV status and identify associated injuries

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Up to 95% have MT fractures</li>

        <li>Up to 40% have tarsal fractures</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Compartment syndrome: sustained increase in compartment pressure due to inflammation and edema in one or more of the foot
    compartments leading to vascular compromise and muscle death

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Crush injuries are particularly susceptible</li>

        <li>Signs include diminished pulses, severe swelling and pain out of proportion to injury, particularly with passive
        extension of the digits</li>

        <li>Compartment pressures should be measured when signs of compartment syndrome are present</li>

        <li>Urgent fasciotomy of the compartments is warranted for pressures within 30 mmHg of the diastolic blood pressure</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
