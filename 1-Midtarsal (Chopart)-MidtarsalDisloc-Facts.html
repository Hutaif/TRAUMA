  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Injuries usually due to high-energy trauma (e.g. MVC)<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>The midtarsal joint (also known as the transverse tarsal or Chopart joint) consists of the calcaneocuboid and
    talonavicular joints

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Acts in concert with subtalar joint in inversion/eversion</li>

        <li>More mobile with heel in pronation</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Two column concept: structural description of the foot

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Medial: 1st, 2nd and 3rd MTs, the 3 cuneiforms, navicular and talus</li>

        <li>Lateral: 4th and 5th MTs, cuboid and calcaneus</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Cuboid acts as link between three naviculocuneiform joints</li>

    <li>Talonavicular joint motion should be preserved when possible due to importance in kinematics</li>

    <li>Ligamentous attachments include:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Calcaneonavicular (spring) ligament: strong plantar complex, primary restraint for talonavicular joint</li>

        <li>Calcaeneocuboid and cuboideonavicular ligaments: support transverse tarsal joint</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Acetabulum pedis: a deep socket that holds the head of the talus

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Consists of navicular, anterior and middle calcaneal facets, calcaneonavicular and bifurcate ligaments</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Foot compartments:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Medial: abductor hallucis, flexor hallucis brevis</li>

        <li>Interosseous: 7 interossei muscles</li>

        <li>Central superficial: flexor digitorum brevis, adductor hallucis, lumbricals</li>

        <li>Central deep (calcaneal): quadratus plantae</li>

        <li>Lateral: flexor digiti minimi brevis, abductor digiti minimi, opponens digiti minimi</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>Patients usually present with tenderness dorsally and deformity</li>

    <li>High-energy mechanisms warrant a full trauma evaluation and resuscitation

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Stress maneuvers to the midfoot may reproduce pain</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Injuries may be bony, ligamentous or combined</li>

    <li>Joint dislocations often reduce spontaneously prior to presentation</li>

    <li>Assess NV status and identify associated injuries</li>

    <li>Compartment syndrome: sustained increase in compartment pressure due to inflammation and edema in one or more of the foot
    compartments leading to vascular compromise and muscle death

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Crush injuries are particularly susceptible</li>

        <li>Signs include diminished pulses, severe swelling and pain out of proportion to injury, particularly with passive
        extension of the digits</li>

        <li>Compartment pressures should be measured when signs of compartment syndrome are present</li>

        <li>Urgent fasciotomy of the compartments is warranted for pressures within 30 mmHg of the diastolic blood pressure</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
