    <big><b>Facts</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Diverse group of fractures that result from axial loading with valgus (more common) or varus stress

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>70-80% of fractures involve lateral plateau</li>

        <li>10-20% involve the medial plateau</li>

        <li>10-30% are bicondylar</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Highest incidence in the fifth decade of life</li>

    <li>Eldery patients are more likely to have depression fractures due to osteopenic bone</li>

    <li>Younger patients are more likely to have ligamentous disruption<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Lateral plateau is convex and sits slightly above the medial plateau, creating 3&deg; of varus

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Overall knee alignment is 7&deg; of valgus due to geometry of femur</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Medial plateau is concave, larger and stronger than the lateral plateau</li>

    <li>Tibial plateau has 6-10&deg; of posterior slope</li>

    <li>Both medial and lateral tibial condyles have fibrocartilaginous meniscii that serve to increase the contact area with the
    distal femur and absorb shock</li>

    <li>Tibial spines (intercondylar eminences) are nonarticular

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Serve as attachment points for the meniscii</li>

        <li>ACL inserts anterior and between the two spines</li>

        <li>PCL inserts along the posterior proximal tibia</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>MCL inserts broadly along the medial and posteriomedial tibia</li>

    <li>LCL inserts on the fibular head</li>

    <li>Important landmarks include the tibial tubercle anteriorly (patellar tendon insertion), the pes anserinus medially (means
    goose foot in Latin, insertion of the medial hamstring - sartorius, gracilis, semitendinosis) and Gerdy's tubercle laterally
    (iliotibial band insertion)</li>

    <li>Anteromedial tibia is subcutaneous

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>At risk for open wounds</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Neurovascular structures at risk include the popliteal artery and peroneal nerve

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Popliteal vessels emerge from adductor hiatus to enter the popliteal fossa posteriorly

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Five geniculate branches</li>

            <li>Proceeds under soleus through a fibrous tunnel</li>

            <li>Trifurcation into posterior tibial, peroneal and anterior tibial arteries occur near this point</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Common peroneal nerve courses around the fibular neck</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>Patients typically present with knee pain and variable degrees of swelling and ecchymosis</li>

    <li>Assess NV status and identify associated injuries including compartment syndrome and vascular injuries

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Medial plateau fractures are at higher risk of neurovascular injury due to higher energy</li>

        <li>Vascular disruption are more commonly intimal tears or thrombosis</li>

        <li>Meniscal tears occur in 50%</li>

        <li>Ligamentous disruption, including cruciates, is present in up to 30%

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Can be examined under anesthesia after fracture fixation has been achieved</li>

            <li>Joint widening of more than 10&deg; with varus/valgus testing suggests ligamentous injury</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Open fractures must be ruled out in the presence of any skin lacerations

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>A saline injection into the joint can be used to determine continuity with lacerations</li>

        <li>Perform arthrocentesis (remove hemarthrosis) followed by injection of saline (~50 cc)</li>

        <li>Extravasation from the wound indicates continuity with the joint and open fracture</li>

        <li>Presence of an open fracture or joint involvement requires urgent surgical debridement</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Compartment syndrome: sustained increase in compartment pressure due to inflammation and edema in one or more of the leg
    compartments leading to vascular compromise and muscle death

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Muscle death occurs 6-8 hours after the onset of compartment syndrome</li>

        <li>Severe pain with passive motion of the toes/foot is often first sign</li>

        <li>Other signs include tense swelling of the calf, diminished pulses, pain out of proportion to injury and paresthesias

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Serial neurovascular exams are required as compartment syndrome can develop more than 24 hours after injury</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Compartment pressures should be measured in patients with clincal signs of compartment syndrome

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Compartment pressure &gt; 30 mmHg or within 30 mmHg of the diastolic blood pressure warrant urgent fasciotomies
            of the leg compartments</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Deep posterior compartment pressure may be elevated in the presence of a soft superficial compartment

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Missed posterior compartment syndrome can result in claw toe deformity</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
