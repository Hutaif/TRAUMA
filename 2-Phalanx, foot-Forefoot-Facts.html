  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Metatarsal (MT) fractures are commonly due to a direct blow or twisting mechanism</li>

    <li>Phalanx fractures are the most common fracture of the forefoot

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>1st and 5th digits are involved most frequently</li>

        <li>Usually due to a crush or stub mechanism</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Dislocations of the IP and MTP joints are commonly due to dorsiflexion and axial loading<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Forefoot (all structures distal to the TMT joint) provides a broad surface for weight-bearing

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>The four lesser MTs and the 1st MT (with its two sesmoids) support half of the forefoot load during normal gait</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint motion is essential for comfort and normal gait</li>

    <li>Mobility in the sagittal plane allows accommodation to uneven surfaces

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Allows relatively even pressure distribution</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Alterations in structure affect this loading pattern

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Dorsal displacement can lead to overload of adjacent MTs and transfer metatarsalgia (pain under the MT heads,
        typically the 2nd or 3rd)</li>

        <li>Plantar displacement can lead to plantar keratoses and pain</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Transverse MT ligaments at the neck and intermetatarsal ligaments proximally connect lesser MTs to each other

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Dense ligamentous attachments proximally anchor MTs to the tarsal bones

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>TMT joint motion increases from 2nd to 5th MC</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Due to these structures, isolated MT fractures rarely displace</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>1st and 5th MT provide protection and stability to others</li>

    <li>Stress fractures are common at the necks of the 2nd/3rd and proximal 5th MCs</li>

    <li>Foot compartments:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Medial: abductor hallucis, flexor hallucis brevis</li>

        <li>Interosseous: 7 interossei muscles</li>

        <li>Central superficial: flexor digitorum brevis, adductor hallucis, lumbricals</li>

        <li>Central deep (calcaneal): quadratus plantae</li>

        <li>Lateral: flexor digiti minimi brevis, abductor digiti minimi, opponens digiti minimi</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>Patients typically present with pain, visible deformity and variable swelling</li>

    <li>Point tenderness, crepitus and deformity are consistent with fractures</li>

    <li>Assess NV status and identify associated injuries</li>

    <li>Compartment syndrome: sustained increase in compartment pressure due to inflammation and edema in foot compartments
    leading to vascular compromise and muscle death

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Crush injuries increase risk</li>

        <li>Signs include tense swelling, diminished pulses, and pain out of proportion to injury, particularly with passive
        extension of the digits</li>

        <li>Compartment pressures should be measured when signs of compartment syndrome are present</li>

        <li>Urgent fasciotomies of the compartments are warranted for pressures within 30 mmHg of the diastolic blood
        pressure</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>First metatarsal</u>:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Lack of interconnecting ligaments with other MTs allows independent motion</li>

        <li>Tibialis anterior inserts on the medial plantar base (extends)</li>

        <li>Peroneus longus inserts on the lateral plantar base (flexes)</li>

        <li>Two sesmoids within the flexor hallucis brevis (FHB) tendon lie under the head and share in weight-bearing</li>

        <li>More often open or comminuted fractures due to higher energy injuries</li>

        <li>Crucial in weight-bearing: anatomic reduction is necessary</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Central metatarsals</u>:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Transverse metatarsal ligament connects the MTs at their heads</li>

        <li>Tarsometatarsal joints increase in mobility from 2nd to 5th</li>

        <li>Evaluate for Lisfranc injury (weight-bearing films), especially with involvement of the base of the 2nd MC</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Fifth metatarsal</u>:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Peroneus brevis inserts on the dorsum of the tubercle</li>

        <li>Peroneus tertius inserts on the dorsum of the proximal diaphysis</li>

        <li>Os peroneum: an ossicle that may be present lateral to the cuboid within the peroneus longus tendon</li>

        <li>Os vesalianum: an accessory bone that may be present medial to the insertion of the peroneus brevis tendon</li>

        <li>Proximal diaphyseal-metaphyseal region is a vascular watershed zone at risk for delayed union or nonunion</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>First MTP</u>:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Normal ROM: 75&deg; of dorsiflexion and 35&deg; of plantarflexion</li>

        <li>Strong constraints: dorsal capsule/extensor hallucis longus, plantar plate/flexor hallucis longus (FHL), flexor
        hallucis brevis (FHB), medial/lateral collateral ligaments as well as conformity of the convex proximal phalanx and the
        concave metatarsal head</li>

        <li>Turf toe: hyperextension sprain of the 1st MTP with injury to the plantar plate and capsule</li>

        <li>Dislocations are rare and typically result from high-energy trauma

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Commonly associated with other injuries to the foot</li>

            <li>Usually dorsal with proximal phalanx displaced proximally</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Articular injury may result in hallux rigidus</li>

        <li>Test stability against contralateral side, particularly translation with dorsoplantar stress

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Significant difference between sides implies ligamentous disruption</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Sesamoids</u>:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Two sesamoids are part of the plantar plate complex of the 1st MTP joint</li>

        <li>They lie in the FHB tendon at the level of the 1st MTP with the FHL running between them</li>

        <li>Intersesamoid ligaments connects the two sesamoids</li>

        <li>Serve as shock absorbers and as a fulcrum for the 1st toe</li>

        <li>Stress fractures are the result of repetitive hyperextension as in ballet and runners or acute fracture due to
        hyperextension and flexor tension</li>

        <li>Medial sesamoid is more frequently fractured due to increased weight-bearing</li>

        <li>Bipartite sesamoids are common (10-30%),

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Up to 85% are bilateral</li>

            <li>More commonly observed in the medial sesamoid</li>

            <li>Can be differentiated from fracture by smooth, sclerotic edges</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Osteochondritis dissecans: avascular subchondral bone necrosis

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Can be differentiated from a fracture by appearance of fragmentation and irregularity</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Patients present with point tenderness under the sesamoid</li>

        <li>Dorsiflexion of the 1st MTP can exacerbate the pain</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Lesser MTPs</u>: generally suffer injuries from stubbing mechanisms (hyperdorsiflexion)

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Most common in 5th MTP</li>

        <li>Stability conferred by articular congruity, plantar capsule, transverse MT ligament, tendons and lumbricals</li>

        <li>Dislocations usually dorsal</li>

        <li>Typically present with dorsal foot pain</li>

        <li>Examination usually reveals disruption in the normal cascade of the toes</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>IP joint dislocations</u>: usually involve the PIP joint

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Typically dorsal in direction</li>

        <li>Most commonly occurs in 1st toe</li>

        <li>Proximal/distal IP joint motion of the lesser toes is not crucial to gait or foot function</li>

        <li>Patients present with an obviously deformed, cocked-up toe</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Phalanx</u>:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>1st toe phalangeal alignment is important to prevent symptomatic arthrosis</li>

        <li>Most lesser toe fractures heal well with symptomatic treatment</li>

        <li>A subungual hematoma may indicate distal phalanx fracture</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
