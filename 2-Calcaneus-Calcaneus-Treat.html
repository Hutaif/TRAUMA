    <big><b>Treatment</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Initial treatment for calcaneus fractures includes cleansing and dressing of any open wounds followed by compression with
    a bulky Jones dressing to reduce swelling

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Jones dressing: cotton padding and elastic bandage layered successively two to three times around foot and ankle</li>

        <li>Delay surgery for up to 3 weeks to allow for sufficient healing of the soft tissues to reduce risk of postoperative
        wound complications

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Clear fluid-filled blisters retain epithelial cells and re-epithelialize quicker</li>

            <li>Blood filled blisters represent more significant injury and do not retain epithelial cells</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Nonoperative</b>: indicated for extraarticular or nondisplaced posterior facet fractures, highly comminuted fractures in
      osteopenic bone or calcaneocuboid joint involvement &lt; 25%

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>NWB in a splint followed by transition to a fracture boot, range of motion exercises and progressive
        weight-bearing</li>

        <li>NWB is required for approximately 10 weeks</li>

        <li>Essex-Lopresti maneuver: reduction of tongue-type fractures can be achieved with percutaneous Steinmann pin
        manipulation</li>

        <li>Due to increased risk of wound complications, some diabetics and smokers may be better served with nonoperative
        treatment</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Operative</b>: indications include displaced posterior facet or open fractures, calcaneocuboid involvement &gt; 25%

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Thorough irrigation and debridement of open wounds is necessary</li>

        <li>Restore congruity of the subtalar articulation, B&ouml;hler's angle, neutralize varus alignment, calcaneocuboid
        articulation and normal height/width of calcaneus</li>

        <li>ORIF through lateral L incision allows direct visualization of the subtalar joint

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Protect sural nerve</li>

            <li>Reduce anterior process, posterior tuberosity, posterior facet, lateral wall and buttress with lateral plate</li>

            <li>Medial approach allows direct visualization of sutentaculum tali but risks neurovascular structures</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Primary subtalar arthrodesis is generally not recommended but may be appropriate for Sanders IV fractures</li>

        <li>Early subtalar ROM is important to minimize stiffness</li>

        <li>Typical time to weight-bearing is 3 months</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Anterior process</u>: generally nonoperative

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Small symptomatic fragments can be excised</li>

        <li>Larger (&gt; 1 cm) displaced fragments should be fixed</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Tuberosity</u>: significant displacement should be urgently treated with open reduction to avoid skin necrosis
    </li>
  </ul><br />

  <div class="page-title">
    <big><b>Complications</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Chronic pain: more common in work related injuries</li>

    <li>Compartment syndrome (10%): urgent fasciotomy is required to release pressure and avoid muscle death</li>

    <li>Increased heel width: may result in lateral impingement on the peroneal tendons or fibula</li>

    <li>Posttraumatic arthritis: subtalar or calcaneocuboid

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>May require salvage arthrodesis but due to the coupled motion of the hindfoot joints (subtalar, calcaneocuboid,
        talonavicular), this essentially eliminates motion at the remaining joints</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Stiffness: most patients lose up to 50% of their subtalar motion despite rehabilitation</li>

    <li>Sural neuropathy: associated with lateral approach</li>

    <li>Wound dehiscence: most common at the angle of incision

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Frequently leads to calcaneal osteomyelitis</li>

        <li>Minimize occurrence by delaying surgery until soft tissues edema has resolved</li>

        <li>Risk factors include high body mass index, open fractures, diabetes and smoking</li>
      </ul>
