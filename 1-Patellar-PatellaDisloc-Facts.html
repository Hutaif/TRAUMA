  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Largest sesamoid bone in the human body</li>

    <li>Dislocations are associated with direct blows, particularly during sudden changes in direction (e.g. cutting
    maneuver)<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Patella increases lever arm and extensor moment of the knee extensor mechanism</li>

    <li>Joint reactive force during normal activities can equal 3x body weight and during deep knee bend up to 8x</li>

    <li>Medial and lateral retinacula are strong expansions of the quadriceps that insert on the tibia</li>

    <li>Lateral aspect of the femoral trochlear groove is more prominent and extends further anteriorly</li>

    <li>Blood supply from geniculate arteries (popliteal)</li>

    <li>Dislocation is more common in females due to physiologic laxity</li>

    <li>Q angle is the angle subtended by a line between the anterior inferior iliac spine to the center of the patella and a
    line between the center of the patella to the center of the tibial tubercle

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Normal Q angle is 14&deg; (male) and 17&deg; (female) of valgus</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Static stabilizers:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL): major soft tissue restraint to lateral displacement</li>

        <li>Medial patellotibial ligament</li>

        <li>Medial patellomeniscal ligament</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Dynamic stabilizers:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Vastus medialis oblique (VMO): provides medially directed stabilizing force during extension</li>

        <li>Quadriceps</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Dislocations are associated with patella alta (high riding patella), hypoplasia of the trochlea or vastus medialis,
    increased Q angle, increased femoral anteversion, genu valgum

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Lateral: most common, due to forced IR of the femur on an externally rotated and planted tibia</li>

        <li>Medial: rare, usually iatrogenic or associated with congenital abnormality</li>

        <li>Intraarticular: very rare, result from quadriceps avulsion</li>

        <li>Superior: very rare, result from osteophyte impingement</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>Patients present with knee effusion, inability to flex the knee and obvious deformity</li>

    <li>Patellar dislocations can spontaneously relocate prior to presentation leaving few signs of dislocation

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Apprehension test: laterally directed force on the reduced patella in the extended position reproduces sensation of
        impending dislocation</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Tenderness to palpation along the medial patella suggests ligamentous disruption</li>

    <li>Assess NV status and identify associated injuries</li>

    <li>Chondral injuries are common</li>
  </ul>
