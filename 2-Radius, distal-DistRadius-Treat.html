  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>
      <b>Closed reduction</b>:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Objective: restore acceptable alignment</li>

        <li>Perform neurovascular evaluation pre- and post-reduction</li>

        <li>Provide anesthesia via hematoma block

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Plain lidocaine is injected directly into fracture site</li>

            <li>Can be effectively applied within 24-48 hours after injury</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Reduction maneuver: accentuate deformity while providing longitudinal traction to "unlock" fracture then rotate
        distal fragment over proximal fragment into anatomic position</li>

        <li>Finger-trap traction and assistant counter traction above the elbow can be helpful</li>

        <li>Cleanse and dress any open wounds</li>

        <li>Sugar tong splint should then be applied in mild wrist flexion, pronation and ulnar deviation

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Avoid extreme wrist flexion as it increases carpal tunnel pressure</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Obtain post-reduction radiographs to confirm acceptable alignment</li>

        <li>Loss of reduction indicates fracture instability and warrants fixation</li>

        <li>Acute carpal tunnel syndrome that persists after reduction requires immediate release</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Acceptable alignment</b>: radial height and volar tilt are most important functionally

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>&lt; 3 mm loss of radial height</li>

        <li>&lt; 5&deg; change in radial inclination</li>

        <li>&lt; 10&deg; loss of volar tilt</li>

        <li>DRUJ reduction</li>

        <li>&lt; 1-2 mm of articular displacement</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Nonoperative</b>: indicated for stable fractures in acceptable alignment

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Accounts for about 75% of fractures</li>

        <li>Transition from splint to cast after swelling subsides

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>It is currently not clear if a short or long arm cast is preferred</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Stabilization for 6 weeks to be transitioned to a removable splint for 2-3 more weeks</li>

        <li>Greater initial displacement, regardless of alignment post-reduction, increases probability of closed treatment
        failure</li>

        <li>Older patients who may tolerate malunion may be better served with nonoperative treatment</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Operative</b>: indications include when closed reduction fails to achieve adequate alignment or when fractures are
      unstable

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Goal of fixation is to allow early motion and rehabilitation</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Closed reduction/percutaneous pinning (CRPP)</u>: K-wires can be used for minimally comminuted and non-osteoporotic
      fractures

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Typically placed from radial styloid to dorsal ulnar aspect of radius to maintain alignment after closed
        reduction</li>

        <li>Does have risk of pin site infections, injury to superficial radial nerve and complex regional pain syndrome</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>External fixation</u>: considered for fractures that lose reduction in cast treatment or for severe metaphyseal
      comminution

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Two pins in 2nd MC and two pins in the radial metaphysis</li>

        <li>Nonbridging external fixators can also be used to allow early ROM</li>

        <li>Supplemental percutaneous pin fixation can be utilized</li>

        <li>Subject to similar infection risks as CRPP</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>ORIF</u>: allows direct visualization and manipulation of the fracture

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Volar plate fixation with angled locked screws/pegs most common

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Provides easier reduction since volar surface is commonly less comminuted</li>

            <li>Pronator quadratus provides soft tissue coverage over plate</li>

            <li>Allows restoration of the thicker volar cortex</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Dorsal plates can be used but are associated with tendon (extensor pollicis longus) ruptures

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Allows for buttressing of dorsal rim and dorsally angulated fractures</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Bone graft may be beneficial for severely comminuted fractures</li>

        <li>Arthroscopic assistance may improve articular reduction and identification of triangular fibrocartilage complex
        (TFCC) tears</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>DRUJ treatment after reduction of the distal radius (Fernandez classification):<br />
      <u>Type IA/B</u>: no additional treatment, encourage early pronation/supination<br />
      <u>Type II</u>: may require transfixation of the ulna to the radius with K-wires

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>A: reduce subluxation, &plusmn; arthroscopic repair of the TFCC, followed by sugar tong splint immobilization in 45&deg; of
        supination</li>

        <li>B: fixation of the ulnar styloid, sugar tong splint immobilization in 45&deg; of supination</li>
      </ul><u>Type IIIA</u>: anatomic reduction of sigmoid notch fragments

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Residual subluxation should be treated as in type II</li>
      </ul><u>Type IIIB</u>: nonoperative, encourage early pronation/supination
    </li>
  </ul><br />

    <big><b>Complications</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Complication rate 20-27%</li>

    <li>Compartment syndrome: requires urgent fasciotomy to release pressure and avoid muscle death</li>

    <li>Complex regional pain syndrome: severe pain and swelling without obvious cause

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Treat with hand therapy, sympathetic blockade and correction of nerve entrapment</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) or triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injuries

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Persistent DRUJ instability warrants fixation of the ulnar styloid or repair of the TFCC</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Malunion: corrective osteotomy is indicated for dorsal angulation &gt; 15&deg;</li>

    <li>Median nerve: one of the most common complications

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Mild sensory impairment can be followed clinically</li>

        <li>Persistent significant neuropathy after reduction should be treated with carpal tunnel release</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Midcarpal instability:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Normally radiolunate angle is 0&deg;, scapholunate angle is 45&deg;</li>

        <li>Proximal row acts as "intercalated segment" connecting forearm to hand</li>

        <li>Volar intercalated segment instability (VISI): commonly results from lunotriquetral (LT) dissociation due to LT
        ligament injury

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Lunate flexes due to loss of support from triquetrum</li>

            <li>Scapholunate angle &lt; 30&deg;</li>

            <li>Radiolunate angle &gt; 15&deg; of flexion</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Dorsal intercalated segment instability (DISI): commonly due to scaphoid fracture or scapholunate ligament injury

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Lunate extends due to loss of support from radius (via the scaphoid)</li>

            <li>Scapholunate angle &gt; 70&deg;</li>

            <li>Radiolunate angle &gt; 10&deg; extension</li>

    </div>
  </ul>



  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Nonunion: rare, usually associated with smoking or inadequate immobilization</li>

    <li>Tendon rupture: extensor pollicis longus most common

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Can occur even after nondisplaced fracture</li>

        <li>Due to tendon degeneration after vascular disruption or mechanical impingement due to callus or dorsal plate</li>

        <li>Suspect when patients report crepitus/pain dorsally with movement of the thumb</li>
