    <big><b>Treatment</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <u>Perilunate dislocations and fracture-dislocations</u>:

    <li>Urgent closed reduction followed by surgery

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Timing based on degree of swelling</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Reduction can be achieved with 10 lb of hanging traction

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>After time to allow muscle spams to subside, a dorsal directed force is applied to stabilize the lunate while a volar
        directed force is used to relocate the carpus</li>

        <li>Volarflexion of the carpus can reduce the capitate into the lunate concavity</li>

        <li>Irreducible dislocations are usually due to interposed capsule</li>

        <li>Postreduction films should be obtained to evaluate distal radius, ulna, carpal height, Gilula's lines, interosseous
        spaces, scapholunate and radiolunate angles</li>

        <li>Instability and/or displacement almost always persists postreduction necessitating fixation</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>Percutaneous pinning: can be considered when closed reduction can be obtained

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Limited ability to reduce rotation and fracture fragments</li>

        <li>K-wire placed through lunate into radius</li>

        <li>Triquetrum is pinned to lunate</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>ORIF: current standard of care for most perilunate injuries

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Preferred to achieve restoration of normal alignment and fracture reduction</li>

        <li>Dorsal approach allows for reduction and ligament repair</li>

        <li>Volar approach allows for decompression of the carpal tunnel and repair of the volar capsule</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Radiocarpal fracture-dislocations</u>:
    </li>

    <li>Goals include: concentric reduction, identification and treatment of intercarpal injuries and repair of osseous
    ligamentous avulsions</li>

    <li>Closed reduction with traction and reversal of deformity should be performed acutely with splint immobilization</li>

    <li><b>Nonoperative</b>: closed reduction and casting has been reported with satisfactory results</li>

    <li>
      <b>Operative</b>: generally preferred

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Provisional reduction with longitudinal traction</li>

        <li>Decompression of the carpal tunnel and Guyon canal through a volar approach</li>

        <li>Exposure, irrigation and debridement of the radiocarpal joint</li>

        <li>Treatment of intercarpal injuries via a dorsal approach</li>

        <li>Fracture fixation with K-wires, screws or plates</li>

        <li>Repair of the ligamentous and capsular structures with sutures or suture anchors</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Scapholunate instability</u>:
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Nonoperative</b>: can be considered for cases of isolated dynamic instability (normal static radiographs)

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Cast or splint immobilization for 6-8 weeks</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Operative</b>: when static instability exists, scaphoid requires wrist extension, lunate require wrist flexion to
      maintain reduction (not achievable nonoperatively)

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Percutaneous pinning: can be performed in conjunction with cast immobilization for 8 weeks</li>

        <li>Open reduction with ligament reconstruction can be considered acutely

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Performed via a dorsal approach to repair SL ligament with sutures or anchors</li>

            <li>Capsulodesis augmentation is considered for subacute presentations (&gt; 4 weeks but &lt; 24 weeks)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Lunotriquetral dissociation</u>:
    </li>

    <li>Acutely treat with SAC or splint for 6-8 weeks when reduction can be achieved</li>

    <li>Percutaneous pinning can be performed to maintain reduction</li>

    <li>Residual deformity or malalignment requires open reduction, ligament reconstruction and pinning via a dorsal &plusmn; volar
    approach</li>
  </ul><br />

    <big><b>Complications</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <u>Perilunate dislocations and fracture-dislocations</u>

    <li>Chronic dislocation can result in persistent pain, instability, tendon ruptures and nerve injury</li>

    <li>Median neuropathy: associated with stage IV dislocations</li>

    <li>Posttraumatic arthritis: can develop secondary to chondrolysis, scaphoid nonunion, persistent instability

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>May require salvage procedure such as proximal row carpectomy or radiocarpal fusion</li>

        <li>Wrist stiffness: often related dissection associated with open treatment</li>

        <li>Percutaneous techniques (application of K-wire joysticks for reduction or percutaneous screw placement) may decrease
        stiffness</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Radiocarpal fracture-dislocations</u>:
    </li>

    <li>Chronic instability</li>

    <li>Posttraumatic arthritis</li>

    <li>Wrist stiffness: loss of 30% of motion is typical<br />
    <br />
    <u>Scapholunate instability</u>:</li>

    <li>Residual instability: may require capsulodesis or tendon augmentation</li>

    <li>Chronic instability: can lead to scapholunate advanced collapse (SLAC) and arthritis

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Can treat with scaphotrapeziotrapezoidal fusion, proximal row carpectomy or four-corner fusion (capitate, lunate,
        hamate, triquetrum)</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Lunotriquetral dissociation</u>:
    </li>

    <li>Recurrent instability: may require capsular augmentation or LT fusion</li>
  </ul>
