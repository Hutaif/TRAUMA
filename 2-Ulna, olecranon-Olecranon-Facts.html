  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Most commonly occurs in elderly patients from indirect trauma (sudden pull of the triceps and brachialis)<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Olecranon is defined as the region of the proximal ulna proximal to the coronoid that articulates with the trochlea of
    the distal humerus</li>

    <li>The olecranon ossification center appears around 10 and fuses at 16 years</li>

    <li>Coronoid process acts as an anterior buttress and is vital to stability of the elbow

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Sublime tubercle (medial coronoid): is the insertion of the anterior bundle of the medial collateral ligament
        (MCL)</li>

        <li>Fractures of the coronoid involving the anteromedial facet result from varus posteromedial rotation during axial
        loading

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Associated with LCL injury and instability</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Patella cubiti is a true accessory ossicle located within the triceps tendon near its insertion in the olecranon</li>

    <li>All olecranon fractures are intraarticular by definition</li>

    <li>With the coronoid, the olecranon forms the greater sigmoid notch that articulates with the trochlea of the distal
    humerus</li>

    <li>Provides stability in the anteroposterior plane</li>

    <li>A transverse bare area is present in the articular cartilage midway along the arc of the sigmoid notch<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Patients typically present with inability to extend elbow against gravity, pain, swelling and ecchymosis</li>

    <li>Assess NV status and identify associated injuries</li>

    <li>Ulnar nerve at high risk, particularly with high-energy trauma</li>

    <li>Associated elbow fractures, dislocations or fracture-dislocations are common

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Radial head fractures and dislocations must be identified</li>

        <li>Anterior olecranon fracture-dislocations: typically involve translation of the distal humerus through the olecranon
        with anterior translation of the radius and ulna

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>The radial head is rarely injured</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Posterior olecranon fracture-dislocations: typically involve distal humerus through the olecranon with posterior
        translation of the radial head, radial head fracture, coronoid fracture and LCL injury</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
