    <big><b>Facts</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Most commonly sustained during MVC

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>90% occur on the right, possibly due to leg position while engaging brake pedal</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>40% of femoral head is covered by the acetabulum</li>

    <li>Hip joint has inherent stability due to bony and soft tissue anatomy

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Fibrocartilanginous labrum deepens the acetabulum, increasing coverage and stability</li>

        <li>Thick capsule and ligaments (iliofemoral, pubofemoral and ischiofemoral) provide further support</li>

        <li>Soft tissue structures including the labrum, iliofemoral ligament, capsule, bony fragments and tendons (piriformis,
        psoas) can prevent closed reduction</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Adult femoral head blood supply from:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Deep branch of the medial femoral circumflex artery (MFCA): supplies majority of weight-bearing superior head</li>

        <li>Ligamentum teres (branch of the obturator artery): supplies about 10%</li>

        <li>Lateral femoral circumflex artery (LFCA): minor contribution</li>

        <li>MFCA and LFCA arise from the profunda femoris artery</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Posterior dislocation (85%)</u>:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Patients present with a shortened, flexed, internally rotated and adducted lower extremity</li>

        <li>The result of a posterior force on a flexed hip</li>

        <li>Acetabular fractures occur if hip is in relative abduction</li>

        <li>Femoral head fractures complicate 5-15% of posterior hip dislocations</li>

        <li>Sciatic nerve injury occurs in 10% as it exits the pelvis at the greater sciatic notch deep to the piriformis

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Peroneal divsion more commonly affected than tibial: test tibialis anterior, EHL and peroneals</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Anterior dislocation (15%)</u>:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Patients present with an externally rotated and abducted lower extremity</li>

        <li>Associated with femoral vessel and femoral head indentation injuries</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Inferior/obturator</u>: the result of simultaneous abduction, ER, flexion<br />
      <br />
      <u>Superior</u>: the result of simultaneous abduction, ER, extension<br />
      <br />
    </li>

    <li>Hip dislocations represent an orthopedic emergency requiring prompt reduction to protect femoral head blood supply</li>

    <li>High-energy injury nature warrants a full trauma evaluation and resuscitation</li>

    <li>Assess NV status and identify associated injuries</li>

    <li>Other injuries are common due to the high-energy nature including: abdominal, chest, acetabular, and spine</li>

    <li>50% of patients have fractures

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Almost all femoral head fractures are associated with hip dislocations</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
