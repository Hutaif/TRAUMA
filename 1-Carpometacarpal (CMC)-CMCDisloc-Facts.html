  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Usually the result of high-energy injuries</li>

    <li>Simple dislocations are rare, most are fracture-dislocations</li>

    <li>Hand compartments: dorsal interossei (4), palmar interossei (3), adductor pollicis, thenar and hypothenar</li>

    <li>Compartment syndrome: sustained increase in compartment pressure due to inflammation and edema in one or more of the hand
    compartments leading to vascular compromise and muscle death

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Signs include tense swelling, pain out of proportion to injury and loss of motion</li>

        <li>Sensory exam may be normal</li>

        <li>Hand may assume intrinsic minus position (MCP extension, IP flexion)</li>

        <li>Compartment pressures must be measured when clinical signs of compartment syndrome are present</li>

        <li>Pressure &gt; 15-20 mmHg warrants release of all 10 compartments

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Transverse carpal ligament requires release as well</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Thumb (1st MC-trapezium)</u>:
    </li>

    <li>Most occur from axial loading of a partially flexed thumb</li>

    <li>Joint is structured as a reciprocal saddle joint between the 1st MC and the trapezium

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Volar oblique ligament maintains stability</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Dorsal dislocations involve disruption of the dorsoradial ligament</li>

    <li>Most stable in pronation and extension</li>

    <li>Radial artery passes beneath abductor pollicis longus (APL) and extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) just proximal to the CMC
    joint</li>

    <li>Deforming forces:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Adductor pollicis: adduction and supination</li>

        <li>APL: radial and proximal</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Fingers (2nd MC-trapezoid, 3rd -capitate, 4th/5th -hamate)</u>:
    </li>

    <li>Dislocations of the lesser CMC joints are rare due to relatively rigid anatomic configuration

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Strong ligaments provide stability and form a rigid transverse arch</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>2nd and 3rd CMC joints allow &lt; 5&deg; of motion and form the stable keystone of the transverse and longitudinal arch of
    the hand</li>

    <li>4th and 5th CMC joints allow 15&deg; and 25&deg; of motion respectively

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Injuries of the 4th and 5th CMC joints occur more frequently</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>2nd CMC base is particularly stable due to its wedge shaped articulation with the trapezoid<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Patients present with pain, swelling and deformity</li>

    <li>Most CMC dislocations are dorsal</li>

    <li>Thumb dislocations often present reduced, requiring stress testing to determine residual instability

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Compare with contralateral side</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>The ulnar nerve (motor) is at risk with 5th CMC joint dislocations</li>

    <li>Deep palmar arterial arch is at risk with 3rd CMC joint dislocations</li>

    <li>Fracture-dislocations involving the MC bases and/or the corresponding carpal bones are common

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Disruption of the normal dorsal cascade of MCP joints suggests shortening</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
