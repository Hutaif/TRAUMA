    <big><b>Facts</b></big>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Fractures are usually the result of high-energy trauma</li>

    <li>Most commonly involve the scapular body (50%) followed by the glenoid fossa (25%) and glenoid neck (10%)<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Links upper extremity to axial skeleton

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Acromioclavicular (AC) joint and coracoclavicular (CC) ligaments connect scapula to the clavicle</li>

        <li>CC ligament has two components: trapezoid (lateral) and conoid (medial)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Large muscular envelope protects the scapula

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>17 muscles insert or originate at the scapula: pectoralis minor, omohyoid, serratus anterior, subscapularis, triceps,
        biceps (long and short head), coracobrachialis, rhomboid major and minor, infraspinatus, levator scapulae, supraspinatus,
        trapezius, deltoid, teres minor and major and latissimus dorsi</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Transverse scapular ligament bridges the scapular notch (medial to base of coracoid)

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Suprascapular nerve passes under the ligament through the notch</li>

        <li>Suprascapular artery passes over the ligament</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Spinoglenoid notch lies at the base of the acromion where it meets the scapular spine

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Suprascapular nerve passes through this notch prior to innervating the infraspinatus</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Os acrominale is an unfused acromial apophysis that can be confused with a fracture

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Present in 3% of the population and is bilateral in 60% of cases</li>

        <li>Most common site of nonunion is between mesoacromion and metaacromion in the middle of the acromion</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Superior shoulder suspensory complex:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Bony and ligamentous ring consisting of the glenoid, coracoid, distal clavicle, acromion, CC ligaments, and AC
        joint</li>

        <li>Injury to two or more components can cause shoulder instability and floating shoulder</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Floating shoulder: fracture of the glenoid neck and the ipsilateral clavicle effectively dissociating the upper extremity
    from the axial skeleton

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>True floating shoulder is argued to require disruption to AC and CA ligaments or acromial fracture in addition to
        glenoid neck and clavicular fractures</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Scapulothoracic dissociation: devastating injury involving lateralization of the scapula and upper extremity away from
    the thorax due to severe blunt force and typically includes injury to:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Upper extremity neurovascular structures (i.e. brachial plexus, subclavian or axillary arteries)</li>

        <li>Muscles: rhomboids, levator scapulae, trapezius, latissimus dorsi, pectoralis</li>

        <li>Clavicle, SC and/or AC joint</li>

        <li>Can be identified by lateralization of the scapula on chest radiograph</li>

        <li>Outcomes are generally poor: &gt; 90% have neurologic injury, &gt; 50% result in a flail upper extremity, 20% undergo
        amputation, 10% are fatal</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>Patients typically present with an adducted upper extremity with local tenderness and pain with abduction</li>

    <li>Pain with deep inspiration and variable ecchymosis may be present</li>

    <li>Assess NV status and identify associated injuries</li>

    <li>Scapular body fractures are associated with rib fractures, pneumo/hemothorax, pulmonary contusion, vertebral fractures,
    abdominal injury, head injury and long-bone fracture</li>

    <li>Compartment syndrome is uncommon but must be ruled out in the presence of tense swelling of the supra/infraspinatus

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Comolli sign: triangular swelling over scapula due to hematoma that can increase compartment pressure</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
