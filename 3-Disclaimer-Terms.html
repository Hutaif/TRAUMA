  <p><br />
  1. <b>General</b><br />
  By using Ortho Traumapedia ("OT"), the user expressly agrees that s/he is aware of the following terms, conditions and
  disclaimers, that s/he understands them and that s/he agrees to be bound by them.</p>

  <p>2. <b>No Advice</b><br />
  OT is not designed for laypersons. The information and interventions described in OT are only to be applied in environments
  specially designed and by medical professionals specially certified and trained for such procedures.</p>

  <p>The information provided in OT is for educational and informational purposes only and does not give
  professional advice or recommend particular products, procedures or therapies. The information contained in OT is not intended
  to present the only or necessarily the best products, procedures or therapies. OT contains general principles of medical care
  that should not be construed as specific instructions for care of individual patients.</p>

  <p>No application, source or reference, including OT, is a substitute for sound clinical judgment, experience and
  training. No test or procedure should be carried out unless, in the user's professional judgment, it is justified. Whoever
  applies products, procedures and therapies described in OT will do so at her/his own risk; s/he is responsible for their
  compliance with all local laws, regulations and medical practice applicable. The application of the information contained
  within OT remains the professional responsibility of the practitioner. Because of rapid advances in the medical sciences, <span class="company_llc_name">DMI
  Technologies, Inc.</span> ("<span class="company_short_name">DMI</span>") recommends that independent verification of diagnosis, therapies, examinations, drugs, dosages and
  operation methods should be made before any action is taken.</p>

  <p>All information contained in OT is only intended for off-hours review of concepts, not as an aid while carrying
  out medical procedures or evaluations.</p>

  <p>3. <b>No Warranty</b><br />
  Medical knowledge is constantly changing and evolving. Even though great care has been taken to maintain the accuracy of any
  material and information appearing in OT at the time of its publication, <span class="company_short_name">DMI</span> does not give any warranty or other assurance as
  to its content, accuracy, completeness, timelessness, compliance with local laws, regulations and medical practice or to its

  warranties of any kind. <span class="company_short_name">DMI</span> disclaims any and all representations and warranties of any kind, expressed or implied.</p>

  <p>Any statements about products described in OT do not represent an endorsement or evaluation of or a warranty
  for such products. These statements may not be used in advertising or for any commercial purposes.</p>

  <p>4. <b>No Liability</b><br />
  <span class="company_short_name">DMI</span> disclaims any and all responsibility for any damages or losses (including, without limitation, personal injury, financial
  loss, damages, loss of profits or other consequential losses) arising, directly or indirectly, in contract, tort or otherwise

  a result of using OT or any such material or information. <span class="company_short_name">DMI</span> shall have no liability whatsoever for direct or indirect,
  special or consequential damages relating in any way to the use of information contained herein. The entire risk as to the use
