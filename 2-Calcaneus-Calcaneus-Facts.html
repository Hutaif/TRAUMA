    <big><b>Facts</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Most frequently fractured tarsal bone</li>

    <li>Associated with MVCs and falls from height</li>

    <li>75% are intraarticular (subtalar)<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Three facets articulate with the talus

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Posterior: largest and supports the majority of the weight-bearing</li>

        <li>Middle: located on the sustentaculum tali</li>

        <li>Anterior: confluent with the middle</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Sulcus of the calcaneus (between the middle and posterior facets)</li>

    <li>Sustentaculum tali: a bony shelf that projects medially from the calcaneal body

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Articulates with the talus as part of the subtalar joint</li>

        <li>Supports the neck of the talus medially</li>

        <li>Flexor hallucis longus passes beneath</li>

        <li>Attaches to the talus via talocalcaneal ligaments</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Achilles tendon attaches to the posterior tuberosity (the entire portion of the calcaneus posterior to posterior
    facet)</li>

    <li>Anterior process articulates with the cuboid</li>

    <li>Foot compartments:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Medial: abductor hallucis, flexor hallucis brevis</li>

        <li>Interosseous: 7 interossei muscles</li>

        <li>Central superficial: flexor digitorum brevis, adductor hallucis, lumbricals</li>

        <li>Central deep (calcaneal): quadratus plantae</li>

        <li>Lateral: flexor digiti minimi brevis, abductor digiti minimi, opponens digiti minimi</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Most intraarticular fractures are the result of axial loading where the talus is driven down in the calcaneus</li>

    <li>Outcomes from calcaneus fractures tend to be poor due to complex anatomy<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Patients present with heel pain and variable swelling, widening/shortening of the heel and ecchymosis extending to the
    arch</li>

    <li>Mondor's sign: ecchymosis that extends along the outside of the foot to the sole distally</li>

    <li>Assess skin condition and NV status with particular attention to swelling and open wounds

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>8% are open fractures

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Low-velocity open injuries typically occur medially due to sustentaculum fragment</li>

            <li>Open fractures are associated with higher rates of complications such as infections and amputations</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Identify associated injuries including spine (10%) and extremity fractures (25%)

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>7% have contralateral calcaneus fractures</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Conditions such as diabetes or peripheral vascular disease that predispose to wound healing issues should be
    identified</li>

    <li>Failure of treatment is reportedly higher in worker's compensation patients</li>

    <li>A history of smoking is associated with increased wound complications</li>

    <li>Compartment syndrome: sustained increase in compartment pressure due to inflammation and edema in one or more of the foot
    compartments leading to vascular compromise and muscle death

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Signs include tense swelling, diminished pulses, severe swelling and pain out of proportion to injury, particularly
        with passive extension of the digits</li>

        <li>Most commonly involves the central compartment (intrinsic toe flexors)</li>

        <li>Compartment pressures should be measured when signs of compartment syndrome are present</li>

        <li>Urgent fasciotomy of the compartments is warranted for pressures within 30 mmHg of the diastolic blood pressure</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
