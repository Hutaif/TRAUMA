  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Involves dislocation of the talocalcaneal and talonavicular joints</li>

    <li>Uncommon injury that usually occurs in young adults after fall from height and MVCs</li>

    <li>Medial dislocations of the calcaneus/foot are most common (80%)

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Due to plantarflexion and inversion of the forefoot</li>

        <li>Can lead to buttonholing of the talar head through the anterior capsule and interposition of the extensor digitorum
        brevis, preventing reduction in up to 10% of cases</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Lateral dislocations of the calcaneus/foot (20%)

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Due to plantarflexion and eversion of the forefoot</li>

        <li>Can lead to buttonholing of the talar head through the anterior capsule and interposition of the posterior tibial
        tendon, preventing reduction in up to 20% of cases</li>

        <li>Generally due to higher energy and has a worse prognosis than medial dislocations</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>Patients present with obvious deformity and/or swelling and inability to bear weight</li>

    <li>Assess NV status and identify associated injuries</li>

    <li>Other injuries around the foot and ankle are very common</li>

    <li>High energy nature of injury may warrant full trauma work-up</li>

    <li>Open dislocations can occur in up to 40% of patients</li>
  </ul>
