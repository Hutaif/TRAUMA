    <big><b>Treatment</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Neurologic deficits sustained at the time of injury should be observed, those sustained with manipulation should be
    explored<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>
      <b>Closed reduction</b>: initial management

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Regional anesthesia (e.g. lidocaine) should be applied through the lateral soft tissue triangle formed by three
        landmarks: lateral olecranon, lateral epicondyle and the radial head</li>

        <li>Post-reduction: evaluate neurovascular status, joint stability, antecubital swelling and forearm compartments</li>

        <li>Posterior splint with elbow at 90&deg;

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>For simple dislocations with stable reductions, maintain splint for 1-2 weeks followed by early gentle passive
            ROM</li>

            <li>Unstable reductions require operative treatment</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Reduction maneuvers</b>:<br />
      <u>Posterior</u>:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Closed reduction usually restores stability and allows early motion</li>

        <li>Forearm supination and elbow extension tends to be the most unstable position</li>

        <li>Reduction maneuver: elbow flexed to 90&deg; with distal traction and counter traction on arm

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Often facilitated with patient prone and affected elbow flexed over the edge of the stretcher</li>

            <li>Entrapment of median nerve can occur during reduction</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Anterior</u>:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Triceps avulsion can occur with this injury</li>

        <li>Reduction maneuver: flex forearm, dorsally directed pressure on volar forearm with anteriorly directed pressure on
        arm</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Medial/Lateral</u>:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Lateral dislocations are associated with greater soft tissue injury and instability</li>

        <li>Reduction maneuver: straight medial/lateral pressure with counter-pressure on the arm</li>

        <li>Anconeus interposition may prevent reduction</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Divergent</u>:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Very rare</li>

        <li>Anterior/posterior (more common): ulna posterior, radius anterior

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Reduction maneuver: as with posterior dislocation with additional pressure on radial head anteriorly</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Medial/lateral: distal humerus between radius and ulna

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Reduction maneuver: axial traction with direct pressure to converge ulna and radius</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Operative</b>: indications include soft-tissue or bony entrapment in which closed reduction fails, unstable
      dislocations, neurologic deficits resulting from manipulation, displaced Regan-Morrey type II/III coronoid fractures and
      displaced radial head fractures (terrible triad is considered separately below)<br />
      <br />
      <u>Unstable simple dislocations</u>: can be treated with collateral ligament repair and/or hinged external fixation<br />
      <br />
      <u>Dislocation with coronoid fracture</u>: sutures through drill holes or suture anchors can be used through a lateral
      approach

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Large Regan-Morrey type III fractures can be fixed with a screw applied through the dorsal ulna</li>

        <li>O'Driscoll type 2 fractures may require a separate medial approach, LCL repair and possible hinged external fixation
        for residual instability</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Dislocation with radial head fracture</u>: Mason II and III fractures should be fixed when possible or replaced (see
      Radial Head Fracture chapter)<br />
      <br />
      <u>Terrible Triad</u>:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Usually requires surgery to restore stability</li>

        <li>
          <b>Nonoperative</b>: requires concentric reduction, stability at 30&deg; of flexion or less, minimally displaced radial
          head fracture (by CT) without block to rotation and Regan-Morrey type I coronoid (by CT)

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Immobilize in posterior splint or cast with elbow at 90&deg; for 7-10 days followed by early ROM</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Operative</b>: generally preferred

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Usually through a posterior incision</li>

            <li>Fix coronoid fracture with sutures (Type I/II) or screw (Type III)</li>

            <li>Fix or replace radial head (see Radial Head Fracture chapter)</li>

            <li>Repair anterior capsule</li>

            <li>Repair LCL to lateral epicondyle with suture anchors or drill holes</li>

            <li>MCL may need to be repaired if instability persists after coronoid and lateral repair</li>

            <li>A hinged external fixator may be required for residual instability</li>

            <li>Immobilize for 7-10 days followed by early ROM</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul><br />

    <big><b>Complications</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Compartment syndrome: urgent fasciotomies are required to release pressure and avoid muscle death</li>

    <li>Elbow stiffness: associated with prolonged immobilization (&gt; 3-4 weeks)</li>

    <li>Heterotopic ossification:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Develops between brachialis and capsule or between triceps and capusule</li>

        <li>Can significantly decrease ROM</li>

        <li>Risk increases with greater soft tissue trauma or other fractures</li>

        <li>Consider indomethacin or radiation therapy</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Persistent instability: associated with terrible triad and injury to secondary restraints (e.g. flexor-pronator mass,
    common extensor origin, osteochondral fragments)

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Further imaging and repair of affected anatomy may be required</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Posttraumatic arthritis: can be due to persistent instability

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Monitor for subluxation closely after treatment</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
