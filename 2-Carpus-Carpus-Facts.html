    <big><b>Facts</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Carpal bone fractures are commonly missed, often diagnosed as "wrist sprain"</li>

    <li>Scaphoid fractures are most common</li>

    <li>The carpus is made up of 8 bones grouped into 2 rows

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Distal carpal row: strong ligamentous connections within the row and with the MCs form a rigid transverse arch

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Includes trapezium (articulates with 1st MC), trapezoid (2nd MC), capitate (3rd), hamate (4th and 5th)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Proximal carpal row: articulates with the radius and ulna and includes the scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Pisiform is a sesamoid of the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) tendon and articulates only with the triquetrum</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Scaphoid</u>
    </li>

    <li>Usually the result of a fall onto the radial side of an extended wrist</li>

    <li>80% is covered with articular cartilage</li>

    <li>Represents the deep border of the anatomic snuff box (between EPB and EPL, base of 1st MC and radial styloid)</li>

    <li>Blood supply from radial artery

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Perforating branches enter at dorsal ridge and supply proximal 75%</li>

        <li>Blood supply to the proximal pole is most tenuous</li>

        <li>Volar contributions from the radial artery supply distal pole</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Scaphoid spans both proximal and distal carpal rows as a strut</li>

    <li>Scaphoid rests on radioscapholunate ligament which stabilizes scapholunate articulation and acts as a neurovascular
    conduit</li>

    <li>Rotates from volar-flexed perpendicular position (radial deviation of the wrist) to dorsiflexed longitudinal position
    (ulnar deviation)</li>

    <li>Flexion across scaphoid is balanced with extension at triquetrum</li>

    <li>Midcarpal instability:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Proximal carpal row acts as "intercalated segment", connecting radius/ulna to a rigid distal row</li>

        <li>Dorsal intercalated segment instability (DISI): commonly due to scaphoid fracture or scapholunate ligament injury

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Lunate extends due to loss of support from radius (via the scaphoid)</li>

            <li>With fractures, proximal fragment of scaphoid tends to extend with lunate</li>

            <li>Scapholunate angle: &gt; 70&deg;</li>

            <li>Radiolunate angle: &gt; 10&deg; extension</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

  </ul>



  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Patients present with wrist pain and variable swelling and limitation of ROM</li>

    <li>Snuffbox tenderness in is often present but nonspecific</li>

    <li>Tenderness at the scaphoid tubercle (distal pole, palpable at the volar wrist crease particularly in radial deviation)
    suggests fracture</li>

    <li>Axial compression of the thumb reproduces pain</li>

    <li>Scaphoid shift (Watson) test: ulnar/radial deviation of the wrist while applying manual pressure on scaphoid tubercle

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Clunk or pain suggests scapholunate ligament injury</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Lunate</u>
    </li>

    <li>Often due to a hyperextension injury</li>

    <li>Kienb&ouml;ck's disease: osteonecrosis of the lunate

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Unrecognized fractures can progress to Kienb&ouml;ck's Disease</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Although often well vascularized by an anastomotic network of dorsal and volar vessels, 20% have only a volar blood
    supply</li><br />

    <li>Patients present with localized tenderness to palpation usually along the volar wrist often with painful ROM<br />
    <br />
    <u>Triquetrum</u></li>

    <li>Commonly associated with ulnar styloid fracture</li>

    <li>Rich anastomotic vascular network makes nonunion rare</li>

    <li>Isolated fractures are rare, more commonly associated with perilunate fracture-dislocations</li><br />

    <li>Patients present with localized tenderness on the dorsoulnar aspect of the wrist often with painful ROM and decreased
    grip strength<br />
    <br />
    <u>Pisiform</u></li>

    <li>A sesamoid of the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) tendon</li>

    <li>Articulates only with the triquetrum</li>

    <li>Forms ulnar border of Guyon's canal (deep: transverse carpal ligament, superfical: pisohamate ligament, radial border:
    hamate, contents: ulnar artery and nerve)</li><br />

    <li>Patients present with tenderness to palpation on the volar aspect of the ulnar wrist often with painful passive extension
    of the wrist as the FCU is placed under tension<br />
    <br />
    <u>Trapezium</u></li>

    <li>Results from impaction from axial loading of adducted thumb</li>

    <li>Avulsion of transverse carpal ligament from trapezial ridge may occur</li><br />

    <li>Patients present with tenderness to palpation in the radial wrist often with painful ROM of 1st CMC joint<br />
    <br />
    <u>Trapezoid</u></li>

    <li>Fractures are rare, more likely to dislocate</li><br />

    <li>Patients present with tenderness to palpation proximal to base of the 2nd MC often with painful ROM of 2nd CMC</li>

    <li>Dorsal prominence suggests a dislocated trapezoid<br />
    <br />
    <u>Capitate</u></li>

    <li>Isolated injuries are rare

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Fractures are associated with greater arc perilunate fracture-dislocations</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Single vessel blood supply</li><br />

    <li>Patients present with tenderness and often with painful dorsiflexion of the wrist as the capitate impinges on the dorsal
    rim of the radius</li>

    <li>Palpable deformity may be present at the base of the 3rd MC<br />
    <br />
    <u>Hamate</u></li>

    <li>Hamulus or hook projects from the volar surface

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Forms the ulnar border of the carpal tunnel (deep: carpus, superficial: transverse carpal ligament, radial border:
        scaphoid/trapezium, contents: FDS, FDP, FCR, FPL and median nerve)</li>

        <li>Forms radial border of Guyon's canal (deep: transverse carpal ligament, superficial: pisohamate ligament, ulnar
        border: pisiform, contents: ulnar artery and nerve)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Os hamulus proprium: failure of fusion of the hook ossification center

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Can mimic hook of hamate fractures</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Origin of flexor digiti minimi brevis and opponens digiti minimi may displace hamate fracture and prevent healing</li>

    <li>Hook of hamate fractures are common among athletes due to prominence on ulnar wrist, particularly hockey, golf and
    baseball</li>

    <li>Distal articular surface fractures are rare and associated with 5th MC subluxation<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>Patients present with pain and tenderness over the hamate</li>

    <li>Pain can be accentuated with axial loading of the 4th and 5th digits and active grasp</li>

    <li>Ulnar and median neuropathy may be present as well as ulnar artery injuries</li>
  </ul>
