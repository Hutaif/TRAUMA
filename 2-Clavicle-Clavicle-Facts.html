  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Common injury of young males (middle third) and the elderly (lateral/medial third)</li>

    <li>Generally due to a direct blow to the shoulder</li>

    <li>Middle/lateral third junction (~75%): thin and without muscular attachment making it vulnerable to fracture</li>

    <li>Lateral fractures (~25%)</li>

    <li>Medial fractures (~2%)<br />
    <br /></li>

    <li>First bone to ossify (5th week of gestation) and last ossification center to fuse (25 years)</li>

    <li>Only bone to ossify by intramembranous ossification without endochondral ossification</li>

    <li>Lateral third is flat, medial third is tubular</li>

    <li>Acts as a strut, connecting the upper extremity to the thorax</li>

    <li>Articulates with the acromion laterally: acromioclavicular (AC) and coracoclavicular (CC) ligaments stabilize this
    articulation

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>CC ligament has two components: trapezoid (lateral) and conoid (medial)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Articulates with the sternum medially: sternoclavicular (SC) joint capsule, costoclavicular ligaments, subclavius muscle
    and the interclavicular ligament stabilize this articulation</li>

    <li>Brachial plexus and subclavian artery/vein are at risk for injury with displaced fractures</li>

    <li>Anterior to the clavicle lie the supraclavicular nerves that innervate the skin of the lower neck and upper chest

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>At risk for injury during surgical approach to mid-clavicle</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>Patients present with pain and variable swelling and deformity</li>

    <li>Tenderness to palpation is common</li>

    <li>Assess NV status and identify associated injuries

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>High-energy injuries are associated with pneumo/hemothorax, lung contusion, rib fracture, upper extremity injury and
        head injury</li>

        <li>Hematoma, local bruit, absent pulses, paresthesias and/or distal weakness should raise suspicion of subclavian or
        brachial plexus injury and warrants further investigation</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Condition of the overlying skin and any open wounds should be noted

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Pressure on the skin from bone displacement can cause necrosis and/or convert to open fracture</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
