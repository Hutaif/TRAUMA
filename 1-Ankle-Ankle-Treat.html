    <big><b>Treatment</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Goal of treatment is to restore joint alignment and stability

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Correct fibular length and rotation</li>

        <li>Restore normal talar mechanics - even slight displacement increases contact force between tibia and talus</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Syndesmotic injuries</b>: diagnosed by avulsion fractures of the syndesmotic ligaments, talar shift or physical exam

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Injuries without static instability (normal non-stress radiographs) but with mild dynamic instability (mild widening
        on stress view): short period of immobilization with NWB splint/cast followed by rehabilitation</li>

        <li>Static instability or significant dynamic instability require operative fixation

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Reduce fibula in the incisura fibularis</li>

            <li>Place screw through fibula and tibia via lateral approach 2 cm above plafond and engage either 3 or 4 cortices
            with the foot in maximum dorsiflexion (to prevent over-tightening of the syndesmosis)</li>

            <li>Controversy exists regarding size of screw and timing/necessity of removal</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Acute treatment of all fractures/dislocations</b>: cleanse and dress open wounds or skin abrasions

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Dislocations should be reduced under conscious sedation or local block

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>With knee in flexion (reduce achilles tension) place hand around hindfoot apply traction and reverse deformity
            against countertraction on the tibia</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Reduce displaced fractures and place in a short leg splint (posterior with stir-up) with ankle at 90&deg;</li>

        <li>Confirm alignment with post-reduction films</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Nonoperative indications</b>: nondisplaced/stable patterns with an intact syndesmosis, fractures with stable anatomic
      reduction, patient who cannot tolerate operative treatment

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Transition from splint (see above) to SLC when swelling subsides

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>NWB immobilization generally for 6 weeks</li>

            <li>SER II injuries can be WBAT due to mechanical stability</li>

            <li>Close follow up to monitor displacement</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Operative indications</b>:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>In general: failure to achieve adequate reduction, displaced/unstable fracture patterns with syndesmotic and/or
        deltoid injury, open fractures</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Lateral malleolus</u><br />
      Weber A:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Isolated injuries typically do not require fixation and do well with early functional rehabilitation</li>

        <li>Fixation should be considered for large fragments in the presence of a medial fracture</li>
      </ul>Weber B:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Presence of talar shift or medial malleolar fracture warrants fixation</li>

        <li>Fractures without talar or medial fracture but signs of deltoid ligament injury (tenderness to palpation or positive
        stress test) require fixation</li>
      </ul>Weber C:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Require fixation due to inherent instability of the injury</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Medial malleolus</u>

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Fixation is required when there is a syndesmotic injury, persistent talar displacement despite fibular fixation or
        medial instability (deltoid rupture)</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Posterior malleolus</u>

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Fixation is required when there is &gt; 2 mm of displacement, involvement &gt; 25% of the articular surface or
        persistent subluxation of the talus posteriorly</li>
      </ul>
    <br /></li>

    <li>
      <b>Operative treatment</b>:

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>If unable to treat patient acutely, allow patient and soft tissues to stabilize for up to 7 days before attempting
        ORIF

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Elevate/ice ankle to reduce swelling</li>

            <li>In situations of extreme soft tissue injury or expected prolonged delay of surgery, external fixation can
            maintain a provisional reduction</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Lateral malleolus</u>: in general, perform fibular fixation first through a direct lateral incision

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Weber A: lag screw or tension band wiring</li>

        <li>Weber B/C: posterior anti-glide plate or lag screw with lateral 1/3 semitubular neutralization plate

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>After fixation, intraoperative stressing of the syndesmosis complex to determine if syndesmosis fixation is
            required (see above)</li>

            <li>Performed by applying ER force to the ankle with the foot dorsiflexed or lateral translation force to the fibula
            with a towel clip</li>

            <li>Widening of the syndesmosis (decrease in tibiofibular overlap) under fluoroscopy indicates syndesmotic
            injury</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>In cases of deltoid rupture (medial clear space &gt; 4 mm), the talus generally follows the fibula

          <ul class="third-level">
            <li>Fixation of the fibula should restore the talar alignment and deltoid repair is not necessary given intact medial
            malleolus</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Medial malleolus</u>: through a direct medial incision

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Generally fixed with two cancellous screws or a tension band construct</li>
      </ul><br />
      <u>Posterior malleolus</u>: usually reduces with reduction of the fibula

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Can be fixed with one or two lag screws placed percutaneously anterior to posterior or with posterior anti-glide
        plate</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul><br />

  <div class="page-title">
    <big><b>Complications</b></big>
  </div>

  <ul class="top-level">
    <li>Ankle stiffness: often due to prolonged immobilization</li>

    <li>Compartment syndrome (~1%): urgent fasciotomies are required to release pressure and avoid muscle death</li>

    <li>Infection: &lt; 2% in closed injuries</li>

    <li>Malunion: commonly a shortened/rotated fibula leading to pain or an elongated medial malleolus leading to
    instability</li>

    <li>Nonunion: rare but is more commonly associated with a closed treated medial malleolus due to interposed soft tissue

      <ul class="second-level">
        <li>Revision or excision may be required</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Posttraumatic arthritis: a consequence of any articular injury, can be theoretically minimized with anatomic
    reduction</li>

    <li>Reflex sympathetic dystrophy: rare, reduce risk with anatomic reduction and early return to motion</li>

    <li>Wound problems: injuries undergoing operative fixation in the presence of abrasions or fracture blisters are at a 2x
    increased chance of wound complications</li>
  </ul>
